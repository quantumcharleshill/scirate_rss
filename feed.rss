    <title>The XP Stabiliser Formalism: a Generalisation of the Pauli Stabiliser Formalism with Arbitrary Phases</title>

    <description>We propose an extension to the Pauli stabiliser formalism that includes fractional $2\pi/N$ rotations around the $Z$ axis for some integer $N$. The resulting generalised stabiliser formalism - denoted the XP stabiliser formalism - allows for a wider range of states and codespaces to be represented. We describe the states which arise in the formalism, and demonstrate an equivalence between XP stabiliser states and 'weighted hypergraph states' - a generalisation of both hypergraph and weighted graph states. Given an arbitrary set of XP operators, we present algorithms for determining the codespace and logical operators for an XP code. Finally, we consider whether measurements of XP operators on XP codes can be classically simulated.</description>

    <title>Is quantum advantage the right goal for quantum machine learning?</title>

    <description>Machine learning is frequently listed among the most promising applications for quantum computing. This is in fact a curious choice: Today's machine learning algorithms are notoriously powerful in practice, but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales, and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and the narrative of "beating" classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature the way it does, and provide a few examples for alternative research questions.</description>

    <description>Understanding quantum channels and the strange behavior of their capacities is a key objective of quantum information theory. Here we study a remarkably simple, low-dimensional, single-parameter family of quantum channels with exotic quantum information-theoretic features. As the simplest example from this family, we focus on a qutrit-to-qutrit channel that is intuitively obtained by hybridizing together a simple degradable channel and a completely useless qubit channel. Such hybridizing makes this channel's capacities behave in a variety of interesting ways. For instance, the private and classical capacity of this channel coincide and can be explicitly calculated, even though the channel does not belong to any class for which the underlying information quantities are known to be additive. Moreover, the quantum capacity of the channel can be computed explicitly, given a clear and compelling conjecture is true. This "spin alignment conjecture", which may be of independent interest, is proved in certain special cases and additional numerical evidence for its validity is provided. Finally, we generalize the qutrit channel in two ways, and the resulting channels and their capacities display similarly rich behavior. In a companion paper, we further show that the qutrit channel demonstrates superadditivity when transmitting quantum information jointly with a variety of assisting channels, in a manner unknown before.</description>

    <title>Quantum Tanner codes</title>

    <description>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</description>

    <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Quantum Verification</title>

    <description>We initiate the study of parameterized complexity of $\textsf{QMA}$ problems in terms of the number of non-Clifford gates in the problem description. We show that for the problem of parameterized quantum circuit satisfiability, there exists a classical algorithm solving the problem with a runtime scaling exponentially in the number of non-Clifford gates but only polynomially with the system size. This result follows from our main result, that for any Clifford + $t$ $T$-gate quantum circuit satisfiability problem, the search space of optimal witnesses can be reduced to a stabilizer subspace isomorphic to at most $t$ qubits (independent of the system size). Furthermore, we derive new lower bounds on the $T$-count of circuit satisfiability instances and the $T$-count of the $W$-state assuming the classical exponential time hypothesis ($\textsf{ETH}$). Lastly, we explore the parameterized complexity of the quantum non-identity check problem.</description>

    <title>Benchmarking the Planar Honeycomb Code</title>

    <pubDate>Feb 25 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We improve the planar honeycomb code by describing boundaries that need no additional physical connectivity, and by optimizing the shape of the qubit patch. We then benchmark the code using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate logical error rates and derive metrics including thresholds, lambdas, and teraquop qubit counts. We determine that the planar honeycomb code can create a logical qubit with one-in-a-trillion logical error rates using 7000 physical qubits at a 0.1% gate-level error rate (or 900 physical qubits given native two-qubit parity measurements). Our results cement the honeycomb code as a promising candidate for two-dimensional qubit architectures with sparse connectivity.</description>

    <title>Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time</title>

    <description>In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984], [arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of total time complexity of both the client and the server, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be verified, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082]. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in \{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side isometry), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$ time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].</description>

    <title>Non-Pauli Errors in the Three-Dimensional Surface Code</title>

    <description>A powerful feature of stabiliser error correcting codes is the fact that stabiliser measurement projects arbitrary errors to Pauli errors, greatly simplifying the physical error correction process as well as classical simulations of code performance. However, logical non-Clifford operations can map Pauli errors to non-Pauli (Clifford) errors, and while subsequent stabiliser measurements will project the Clifford errors back to Pauli errors the resulting distributions will possess additional correlations that depend on both the nature of the logical operation and the structure of the code. Previous work has studied these effects when applying a transversal $T$ gate to the three-dimensional colour code and shown the existence of a non-local "linking charge" phenomenon between membranes of intersecting errors. In this work we generalise these results to the case of a $CCZ$ gate in the three-dimensional surface code and find that many aspects of the problem are much more easily understood in this setting. In particular, the emergence of linking charge is a local effect rather than a non-local one. We use the relative simplicity of Clifford errors in this setting to simulate their effect on the performance of a single-shot magic state preparation process (the first such simulation to account for the full effect of these errors) and find that while they lead to an increase in the logical error rate their effect on the threshold is minimal.</description>

    <title>All quantum measurements are asymptotically equivalent</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02593</link>

    <pubDate>Mar 08 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We consider the problem of reproducing one quantum measurement given the ability to perform another. In particular, given the availability of a -- possibly imperfect -- quantum measurement which can be performed multiple times, we study to what extent it can reproduce the measurement statistics and post-measurement state of a second target measurement, in the most general setting where both the available and target measurements are arbitrary generalised quantum measurements. We show that this general problem in fact reduces to the ability to reproduce the statistics of von Neumann measurements, and that in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many uses of the available measurement, a simple protocol based upon `classical cloning' is able to perfectly achieve this task. This shows that asymptotically all (non-trivial) quantum measurements are equivalent. We also study optimal protocols for a fixed number of uses of the available measurement, and show that better protocols than classical cloning can be found in general. Our protocols show that the average error in reproducing a target measurement drops off exponentially fast, and that one can, for example, rapidly improve imperfect measurements by performing them a small number of times. This includes, but is not limited to, improving both noisy and lossy quantum measurements. Finally, we show that in a setting where we perform multiple measurements in parallel, we can moreover achieve finite-rate measurement reproduction, by using block-coding techniques from classical information theory.</description>

    <title>Scrambling Dynamics and Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators in Quantum Many-Body Systems: a Tutorial</title>

    <author>Shenglong Xu, Brian Swingle</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 16 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This tutorial article introduces the physics of quantum information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The goals are to understand how to quantify the spreading of quantum information precisely and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce the general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, in certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-the-time ordered correlator (OTOC). The general behavior of OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, both exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experiment schemes to measure OTOC in various quantum simulators.</description>

    <title>Quantum Differential Privacy: An Information Theory Perspective</title>

    <description>Differential privacy has been an exceptionally successful concept when it comes to providing provable security guarantees for classical computations. More recently, the concept was generalized to quantum computations. While classical computations are essentially noiseless and differential privacy is often achieved by artificially adding noise, near-term quantum computers are inherently noisy and it was observed that this leads to natural differential privacy as a feature. In this work we discuss quantum differential privacy in an information theoretic framework by casting it as a quantum divergence. A main advantage of this approach is that differential privacy becomes a property solely based on the output states of the computation, without the need to check it for every measurement. This leads to simpler proofs and generalized statements of its properties as well as several new bounds for both, general and specific, noise models. In particular, these include common representations of quantum circuits and quantum machine learning concepts. Here, we focus on the difference in the amount of noise required to achieve certain levels of differential privacy versus the amount that would make any computation useless. Finally, we also generalize the classical concepts of local differential privacy, Rényi differential privacy and the hypothesis testing interpretation to the quantum setting, providing several new properties and insights.</description>

    <title>Circuit Extraction for ZX-diagrams can be #P-hard</title>

    <description>The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation using ZX-diagrams, a certain flexible generalisation of quantum circuits that can be used to represent linear maps from $m$ to $n$ qubits for any $m,n \geq 0$. Some applications for the ZX-calculus, such as quantum circuit optimisation and synthesis, rely on being able to efficiently translate a ZX-diagram back into a quantum circuit of comparable size. While several sufficient conditions are known for describing families of ZX-diagrams that can be efficiently transformed back into circuits, it has previously been conjectured that the general problem of circuit extraction is hard. That is, that it should not be possible to efficiently convert an arbitrary ZX-diagram describing a unitary linear map into an equivalent quantum circuit. In this paper we prove this conjecture by showing that the circuit extraction problem is #P-hard, and so is itself at least as hard as strong simulation of quantum circuits. In addition to our main hardness result, which relies specifically on the circuit representation, we give a representation-agnostic hardness result. Namely, we show that any oracle that takes as input a ZX-diagram description of a unitary and produces samples of the output of the associated quantum computation enables efficient probabilistic solutions to NP-complete problems.</description>

    <title>Influence in Completely Bounded Block-multilinear Forms and Classical Simulation of Quantum Algorithms</title>

    <description>The Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture (Theory of Computing '14) says that every low-degree bounded polynomial on the Boolean hypercube has an influential variable. This conjecture, if true, would imply that the acceptance probability of every $d$-query quantum algorithm can be well-approximated almost everywhere (i.e., on almost all inputs) by a $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-query classical algorithm. We prove a special case of the conjecture: in every completely bounded degree-$d$ block-multilinear form with constant variance, there always exists a variable with influence at least $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$. In a certain sense, such polynomials characterize the acceptance probability of quantum query algorithms, as shown by Arunachalam, Briët and Palazuelos (SICOMP '19). As a corollary we obtain efficient classical almost-everywhere simulation for a particular class of quantum algorithms that includes for instance $k$-fold Forrelation. Our main technical result relies on connections to free probability theory.</description>

    <title>A Quantum Polynomial-Time Solution to The Dihedral Hidden Subgroup Problem</title>

    <author>Matthew Moore, Grace Young</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 22 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We present a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for the Hidden Subgroup Problem over $\mathbb{D}_{2^n}$. The usual approach to the Hidden Subgroup Problem relies on harmonic analysis in the domain of the problem, and the best known algorithm using this approach has time complexity in $2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})}$. By focusing on structure encoded in the codomain of the problem, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm which uses this structure to direct a "walk" down the subgroup lattice of $\mathbb{D}_{2^n}$ terminating at the hidden subgroup.</description>

    <description>Biased noise is common in physical qubits, and tailoring a quantum code to the bias by locally modifying stabilizers or changing boundary conditions has been shown to greatly increase error correction thresholds. In this work, we explore the challenges of using a specific tailored code, the XY surface code, for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce an efficient and fault-tolerant decoder, belief-matching, which we show has good performance for biased circuit-level noise. Using this decoder, we find that for moderately biased noise, the XY surface code has a higher threshold and lower overhead than the square CSS surface code, however it performs worse when below threshold than the rectangular CSS surface code. We identify a contributor to the reduced performance that we call fragile boundary errors. These are string-like errors that can occur along spatial or temporal boundaries in planar architectures or during logical state preparation and measurement. While we make partial progress towards mitigating these errors by deforming the boundaries of the XY surface code, our work suggests that fragility could remain a significant obstacle, even for other tailored codes. We expect belief-matching will have other uses, and find that it increases the threshold of the surface code to 0.940(3)% in the presence of circuit-level depolarising noise, compared to 0.817(5)% for a minimum-weight perfect matching decoder.</description>

    <title>Performance of planar Floquet codes with Majorana-based qubits</title>

    <description>Quantum error correction is crucial for any quantum computing platform to achieve truly scalable quantum computation. The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude, and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.</description>

    <title>Generic nonadditivity of quantum capacity in simple channels</title>

    <description>Determining capacities of quantum channels is a fundamental question in quantum information theory. Despite having rigorous coding theorems quantifying the flow of information across quantum channels, their capacities are poorly understood due to super-additivity effects. Studying these phenomena is important for deepening our understanding of quantum information, yet simple and clean examples of super-additive channels are scarce. Here we study a simple family of qutrit channels called the platypus channel, and show that it exhibits super-additivity of coherent information when used jointly with a variety of qubit channels. A higher-dimensional variant of the platypus channel displays super-additivity of quantum capacity together with an erasure channel. Subject to the "spin-alignment conjecture" introduced in a companion paper, our results on super-additivity of quantum capacity extend to lower-dimensional channels as well as larger parameter ranges. In particular, super-additivity occurs between two weakly additive channels each with large capacity on their own, in stark contrast to previous results. Remarkably, a single, novel transmission strategy achieves super-additivity in all examples. Our results show that super-additivity is much more prevalent than previously thought. It can occur across a wide variety of channels, even when both participating channels have large quantum capacity.</description>

    <description>Quantum communication research has in recent years shifted to include multi-partite networks for which questions of quantum network routing naturally emerge. To understand the potential for multi-partite routing, we focus on the most promising architectures for future quantum networks - those connecting nodes close to each other. Nearest-neighbour networks such as rings, lines, and grids, have been studied under different communication scenarios to facilitate the sharing of quantum resources, especially in the presence of bottlenecks. We here analyze the potential of nearest-neighbour quantum networks and identify some serious limitations, by demonstrating that rings and lines cannot overcome common bottleneck communication problems.</description>

    <description>We generalize the concept of folding from surface codes to CSS codes by considering certain dualities within them. In particular, this gives a general method to implement logical operations in suitable LDPC quantum codes using transversal gates and qubit permutations only. To demonstrate our approach, we specifically consider a [[30, 8, 3]] hyperbolic quantum code called Bring's code. Further, we show that by restricting the logical subspace of Bring's code to four qubits, we can obtain the full Clifford group on that subspace.</description>

    <description>Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are quantum stabilizer codes where each stabilizer acts on a constant number of qubits and each qubit is acted on by a constant number of stabilizers. We study qLDPC codes constructed from balanced products and lossless expanders. We found that assuming the existence of 2-sided lossless expander graphs with free group action, the resulting qLDPC codes have constant rate, linear distance, and linear time decoders.</description>

    <pubDate>Mar 03 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We consider a quantum version of the famous low-rank approximation problem. Specifically, we consider the distance $D(\rho,\sigma)$ between two normalized quantum states, $\rho$ and $\sigma$, where the rank of $\sigma$ is constrained to be at most $R$. For both the trace distance and Hilbert-Schmidt distance, we analytically solve for the optimal state $\sigma$ that minimizes this distance. For the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, the unique optimal state is $\sigma = \tau_R +N_R$, where $\tau_R = \Pi_R \rho \Pi_R$ is given by projecting $\rho$ onto its $R$ principal components with projector $\Pi_R$, and $N_R$ is a normalization factor given by $N_R = \frac{1- \text{Tr}(\tau_R)}{R}\Pi_R$. For the trace distance, this state is also optimal but not uniquely optimal, and we provide the full set of states that are optimal. We briefly discuss how our results have application for performing principal component analysis (PCA) via variational optimization on quantum computers.</description>

    <description>Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the Maximum Independent Set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm's performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins.</description>

    <description>We consider estimating the magnitude of a monochromatic AC signal that couples to a two-level sensor. For any detection protocol, the precision achieved depends on the signal's frequency and can be quantified by the quantum Fisher information. To study limitations in broadband sensing, we introduce the integrated quantum Fisher information and derive inequality bounds that embody fundamental tradeoffs in any sensing protocol. These inequalities show that sensitivity in one frequency range must come at a cost of reduced sensitivity elsewhere. For many protocols, including those with small phase accumulation and those consisting of $\pi$-pulses, we find the integrated Fisher information scales linearly with $T$. We also find protocols with substantial phase accumulation can have integrated QFI that grows quadratically with $T$, which is optimal. These protocols may allow the very rapid detection of a signal with unknown frequency over a very wide bandwidth.</description>

    <description>Recent developments in classical simulation of quantum circuits make use of clever decompositions of chunks of magic states into sums of efficiently simulable stabiliser states. We show here how, by considering certain non-stabiliser entangled states which have more favourable decompositions, we can speed up these simulations. This is made possible by using the ZX-calculus, which allows us to easily find instances of these entangled states in the simplified diagram representing the quantum circuit to be simulated. We additionally find a new technique of partial stabiliser decompositions that allow us to trade magic states for stabiliser terms. With this technique we require only $2^{\alpha t}$ stabiliser terms, where $\alpha\approx 0.396$, to simulate a circuit with T-count $t$. This matches the $\alpha$ found by Qassim et al., but whereas they only get this scaling in the asymptotic limit, ours applies for a circuit of any size. Our method builds upon a recently proposed scheme for simulation combining stabiliser decompositions and optimisation strategies implemented in the software QuiZX. With our techniques we manage to reliably simulate 50-qubit 1400 T-count hidden shift circuits in a couple of minutes on a consumer laptop.</description>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms are a promising class of algorithms that can be performed on currently available quantum computers. In most settings, the free parameters of a variational circuit are optimized using a classical optimizer that updates parameters in Euclidean geometry. Since quantum circuits are elements of the special unitary group, we can consider an alternative optimization perspective that depends on the structure of this group. In this work, we investigate a Riemannian optimization scheme over the special unitary group and we discuss its implementation on a quantum computer. We illustrate that the resulting Riemannian gradient-flow algorithm has favorable optimization properties for deep circuits and that an approximate version of this algorithm can be performed on near-term hardware.</description>

    <title>Approximating Output Probabilities of Shallow Quantum Circuits which are Geometrically-local in any Fixed Dimension</title>

    <description>We present a classical algorithm that, for any $D$-dimensional geometrically-local, quantum circuit $C$ of polylogarithmic-depth, and any bit string $x \in {0,1}^n$, can compute the quantity $|<x|C|0^{\otimes n}>|^2$ to within any inverse-polynomial additive error in quasi-polynomial time, for any fixed dimension $D$. This is an extension of the result [CC21], which originally proved this result for $D = 3$. To see why this is interesting, note that, while the $D = 1$ case of this result follows from standard use of Matrix Product States, known for decades, the $D = 2$ case required novel and interesting techniques introduced in [BGM19]. Extending to the case $D = 3$ was even more laborious and required further new techniques introduced in [CC21]. Our work here shows that, while handling each new dimension has historically required a new insight, and fixed algorithmic primitive, based on known techniques for $D \leq 3$, we can now handle any fixed dimension $D > 3$. Our algorithm uses the Divide-and-Conquer framework of [CC21] to approximate the desired quantity via several instantiations of the same problem type, each involving $D$-dimensional circuits on about half the number of qubits as the original. This division step is then applied recursively, until the width of the recursively decomposed circuits in the $D^{th}$ dimension is so small that they can effectively be regarded as $(D-1)$-dimensional problems by absorbing the small width in the $D^{th}$ dimension into the qudit structure at the cost of a moderate increase in runtime. The main technical challenge lies in ensuring that the more involved portions of the recursive circuit decomposition and error analysis from [CC21] still hold in higher dimensions, which requires small modifications to the analysis in some places.</description>

    <title>Three-dimensional quantum cellular automata from chiral semion surface topological order and beyond</title>

    <description>We construct a novel three-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) based on a system with short-range entangled bulk and chiral semion boundary topological order. We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e. not a finite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order (characterized by $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory). Our QCA is obtained by first constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconfined bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is defined. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs defined by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on ${2^n}$-dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by $U(1)_{2^n}$ Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.</description>

    <description>Pauli-based computation (PBC) is driven by a sequence of adaptively chosen, non-destructive measurements of Pauli observables. Any quantum circuit written in terms of the Clifford+$T$ gate set and having $t$ $T$ gates can be compiled into a PBC on $t$ qubits. Here we propose practical ways of implementing PBC as adaptive quantum circuits, and provide code to do the required classical side-processing. Our first scheme reduces the number of quantum gates to $O(t^2)$ (from a previous $O(t^3 / \log t)$ scaling) at the cost of one extra auxiliary qubit, with a possible reduction of the depth to $O(t \log t$), at the cost of $t$ additional auxiliary qubits (second scheme). We compile examples of random and hidden-shift quantum circuits into adaptive PBC circuits. We also simulate hybrid quantum computation, where a classical computer effectively extends the working memory of a small quantum computer by $k$ virtual qubits, at a cost exponential in $k$. Our results demonstrate the practical advantage of PBC techniques for circuit compilation and hybrid computation.</description>

    <title>Quantifying dynamical magic with completely stabilizer preserving operations as free</title>

    <description>In this paper, we extend the resource theory of magic to the channel case by considering completely stabilizer preserving operations (CSPOs) as free. We introduce and characterize the set of CSPO preserving and completely CSPO preserving superchannels. We quantify the magic of quantum channels by extending the generalized robustness and the min relative entropy of magic from the state to the channel domain and show that they bound the single-shot dynamical magic cost and distillation. We also provide analytical conditions for qubit interconversion under CSPOs and show that it is a linear programming feasibility problem and hence can be efficiently solved. Lastly, we give a classical simulation algorithm whose runtime is related to the generalized robustness of magic for channels. Our algorithm depends on some pre-defined precision, and if there is no bound on the desired precision then it achieves a constant runtime.</description>

    <title>Quantum algorithms for estimating quantum entropies</title>

    <description>The von Neumann and quantum Rényi entropies characterize fundamental properties of quantum systems and lead to theoretical and practical applications in many fields. Quantum algorithms for estimating quantum entropies, using a quantum query model that prepares the purification of the input state, have been established in the literature. However, constructing such a model is almost as hard as state tomography. In this paper, we propose quantum algorithms to estimate the von Neumann and quantum $\alpha$-Rényi entropies of an $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$ using independent copies of the input state. We also show how to efficiently construct the quantum circuits for quantum entropy estimation using primitive single/two-qubit gates. We prove that the number of required copies scales polynomially in $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\Lambda$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the additive precision and $\Lambda$ denotes the lower bound on all non-zero eigenvalues. Notably, our method outperforms previous methods in the aspect of practicality since it does not require any quantum query oracles, which are usually necessary for previous methods. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show the efficacy of our algorithms to single-qubit states and study the noise robustness. We also discuss the applications to some quantum states of practical interest as well as some meaningful tasks such as quantum Gibbs state preparation and entanglement estimation.</description>

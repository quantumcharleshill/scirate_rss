    <title>Non-Pauli Errors in the Three-Dimensional Surface Code</title>

    <description>A powerful feature of stabiliser error correcting codes is the fact that stabiliser measurement projects arbitrary errors to Pauli errors, greatly simplifying the physical error correction process as well as classical simulations of code performance. However, logical non-Clifford operations can map Pauli errors to non-Pauli (Clifford) errors, and while subsequent stabiliser measurements will project the Clifford errors back to Pauli errors the resulting distributions will possess additional correlations that depend on both the nature of the logical operation and the structure of the code. Previous work has studied these effects when applying a transversal $T$ gate to the three-dimensional colour code and shown the existence of a non-local "linking charge" phenomenon between membranes of intersecting errors. In this work we generalise these results to the case of a $CCZ$ gate in the three-dimensional surface code and find that many aspects of the problem are much more easily understood in this setting. In particular, the emergence of linking charge is a local effect rather than a non-local one. We use the relative simplicity of Clifford errors in this setting to simulate their effect on the performance of a single-shot magic state preparation process (the first such simulation to account for the full effect of these errors) and find that while they lead to an increase in the logical error rate their effect on the threshold is minimal.</description>

    <title>Fold-Transversal Clifford Gates for Quantum Codes</title>

    <description>We generalize the concept of folding from surface codes to CSS codes by considering certain dualities within them. In particular, this gives a general method to implement logical operations in suitable LDPC quantum codes using transversal gates and qubit permutations only. To demonstrate our approach, we specifically consider a [[30, 8, 3]] hyperbolic quantum code called Bring's code. Further, we show that by restricting the logical subspace of Bring's code to four qubits, we can obtain the full Clifford group on that subspace.</description>

    <title>Counting unitaries of T-depth one</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04163</link>
    <author>Vadym Kliuchnikov</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 10 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We show that the number of T-depth one unitaries on $n$ qubits is $ \sum_{m=1}^{n}\tfrac{1}{m!}\prod_{k=0}^{m-1}(4^n/2^k - 2^k) \times \# \mathcal{C}_n, $ where $\#\mathcal{C}_n$ is the size of the $n$-qubit Clifford group, that is the number of unitaries of T-depth zero. The number of T-depth one unitaries on $n$ qubits grows as $2^{\Omega(n^2)} \cdot \# \mathcal{C}_n$.</description>

    <title>Entanglement estimation in tensor network states via sampling</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04089</link>

    <description>We introduce a method for extracting meaningful entanglement measures of tensor network states in general dimensions. Current methods require the explicit reconstruction of the density matrix, which is highly demanding, or the contraction of replicas, which requires an effort exponential in the number of replicas and which is costly in terms of memory. In contrast, our method requires the stochastic sampling of matrix elements of the classically represented reduced states with respect to random states drawn from simple product probability measures constituting frames. Even though not corresponding to physical operations, such matrix elements are straightforward to calculate for tensor network states, and their moments provide the Rényi entropies and negativities as well as their symmetry-resolved components. We test our method on the one-dimensional critical XX chain and the two-dimensional toric code. Although the cost is exponential in the subsystem size, it is sufficiently moderate so that - in contrast with other approaches - accurate results can be obtained on a personal computer for relatively large subsystem sizes.</description>

    <title>Three-dimensional quantum cellular automata from chiral semion surface topological order and beyond</title>

    <description>We construct a novel three-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) based on a system with short-range entangled bulk and chiral semion boundary topological order. We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e. not a finite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order (characterized by $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory). Our QCA is obtained by first constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconfined bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is defined. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs defined by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on ${2^n}$-dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by $U(1)_{2^n}$ Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.</description>

    <title>Matrix concentration inequalities and efficiency of random universal sets of quantum gates</title>

    <description>For a random set $\mathcal{S}$ of quantum gates we provide bounds on the probability that $\mathcal{S}$ forms a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design. In particular we show how many random gates are needed to have a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design with high probability. We also analyze how $\delta$ concentrates around its expected value $\mathbb{E}\delta$ for random $\mathcal{S}$. Our results are valid for both symmetric and non-symmetric sets of gates.</description>

    <title>Neural-Network Decoders for Quantum Error Correction using Surface Codes:A Space Exploration of the Hardware Cost-Performance Trade-Offs</title>

    <description>Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is required in quantum computers to mitigate the effect of errors on physical qubits. When adopting a QEC scheme based on surface codes, error decoding is the most computationally expensive task in the classical electronic back-end. Decoders employing neural networks (NN) are well-suited for this task but their hardware implementation has not been presented yet. This work presents a space exploration of fully-connected feed-forward NN decoders for small distance surface codes. The goal is to optimize the neural network for high decoding performance, while keeping a minimalistic hardware implementation. This is needed to meet the tight delay constraints of real-time surface code decoding. We demonstrate that hardware based NN-decoders can achieve high decoding performance comparable to other state-of-the-art decoding algorithms whilst being well below the tight delay requirements $(\approx 440\ \mathrm{ns})$ of current solid-state qubit technologies for both ASIC designs $(<30\ \mathrm{ns})$ and FPGA implementations $(<90\ \mathrm{ns})$. These results designates NN-decoders as fitting candidates for an integrated hardware implementation in future large-scale quantum computers.</description>

    <title>Comparison of 2D topological codes and their decoding performances</title>

    <description>Topological quantum codes are favored because they allow qubit layouts that are suitable for practical implementation. An $N$-qubit topological code can be decoded by minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) with complexity $O(\text{poly}(N))$ if it is of CSS-type. Recently it is shown that various quantum codes, including non-CSS codes, can be decoded by an adapted belief propagation with memory effects (denoted MBP) with complexity almost linear in $N$. In this paper, we show that various two-dimensional topological codes, CSS or non-CSS, regardless of the layout, can be decoded by MBP, including color codes and twisted XZZX codes. We will comprehensively compare these codes in terms of code efficiency and decoding performance, assuming perfect error syndromes.</description>

    <title>Entanglement catalysis for quantum states and noisy channels</title>

    <description>Many applications of the emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution, require singlets, maximally entangled states of two quantum bits. It is thus of utmost importance to develop optimal procedures for establishing singlets between remote parties. As has been shown very recently, singlets can be obtained from other quantum states by using a quantum catalyst, an entangled quantum system which is not changed in the procedure. In this work we put this idea further, investigating properties of entanglement catalysis and its role for quantum communication. For transformations between bipartite pure states we prove the existence of a universal catalyst, which can enable all possible transformations in this setup. We demonstrate the advantage of catalysis in asymptotic settings, going beyond the typical assumption of independent and identically distributed systems. We further develop methods to estimate the number of singlets which can be established via a noisy quantum channel when assisted by entangled catalysts. For various types of quantum channels our results lead to optimal protocols, allowing to establish the maximal number of singlets with a single use of the channel.</description>

    <title>An elegant proof of self-testing for multipartite Bell inequalities</title>

    <description>The predictions of quantum theory are incompatible with local-causal explanations. This phenomenon is called Bell non-locality and is witnessed by violation of Bell-inequalities. The maximal violation of certain Bell-inequalities can only be attained in an essentially unique manner. This feature is referred to as self-testing and constitutes the most accurate form of certification of quantum devices. While self-testing in bipartite Bell scenarios has been thoroughly studied, self-testing in the more complex multipartite Bell scenarios remains largely unexplored. This work presents a simple and broadly applicable self-testing argument for N-partite correlation Bell inequalities with two binary outcome observables per party. Our proof technique forms a generalization of the Mayer-Yao formulation and is not restricted to linear Bell-inequalities, unlike the usual sum of squares method. To showcase the versatility of our proof technique, we obtain self-testing statements for N party Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) and Werner-Wolf-Weinfurter-Żukowski-Brukner (WWWŻB) family of linear Bell inequalities, and Uffink's family of N party quadratic Bell-inequalities.</description>

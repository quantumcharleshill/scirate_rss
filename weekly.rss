    <description>Majority vote is a basic method for amplifying correct outcomes that is widely used in computer science and beyond. While it can amplify the correctness of a quantum device with classical output, the analogous procedure for quantum output is not known. We introduce quantum majority vote as the following task: given a product state $|\psi_1\rangle \otimes \dots \otimes |\psi_n\rangle$ where each qubit is in one of two orthogonal states $|\psi\rangle$ or $|\psi^\perp\rangle$, output the majority state. We show that an optimal algorithm for this problem achieves worst-case fidelity of $1/2 + \Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$. Under the promise that at least $2/3$ of the input qubits are in the majority state, the fidelity increases to $1 - \Theta(1/n)$ and approaches $1$ as $n$ increases. We also consider the more general problem of computing any symmetric and equivariant Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ in an unknown quantum basis, and show that a generalization of our quantum majority vote algorithm is optimal for this task. The optimal parameters for the generalized algorithm and its worst-case fidelity can be determined by a simple linear program of size $O(n)$. The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^4 \log n)$ where $n$ is the number of input qubits.</description>

    <description>The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTRANCE vertex, a quantum walk can find another distinguished EXIT vertex using polynomially many queries, though without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperform classical computation.</description>

    <title>On the complexity of implementing Trotter steps</title>

    <description>Quantum dynamics can be simulated on a quantum computer by exponentiating elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use $\left(\eta^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\frac{n^{2/3}}{\eta^{2/3}}\right)n^{1+o(1)}$ gates to simulate uniform electron gas with $n$ spin orbitals and $\eta$ electrons in second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of values, showing that generic $n$-qubit $2$-local Hamiltonians with commuting terms require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates to evolve with accuracy $\epsilon=\Omega(1/poly(n))$ for time $t=\Omega(\epsilon)$. Our proof is based on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal unitaries within the Hamming weight-$2$ subspace, which may be of independent interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian structural properties as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate complexity.</description>

    <title>Sample-optimal classical shadows for pure states</title>

    <description>We consider the classical shadows task for pure states in the setting of both joint and independent measurements. The task is to measure few copies of an unknown pure state $\rho$ in order to learn a classical description which suffices to later estimate expectation values of observables. Specifically, the goal is to approximate $\mathrm{Tr}(O \rho)$ for any Hermitian observable $O$ to within additive error $\epsilon$ provided $\mathrm{Tr}(O^2)\leq B$ and $\lVert O \rVert = 1$. Our main result applies to the joint measurement setting, where we show $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{B}\epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples of $\rho$ are necessary and sufficient to succeed with high probability. The upper bound is a quadratic improvement on the previous best sample complexity known for this problem. For the lower bound, we see that the bottleneck is not how fast we can learn the state but rather how much any classical description of $\rho$ can be compressed for observable estimation. In the independent measurement setting, we show that $\mathcal O(\sqrt{Bd} \epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples suffice. Notably, this implies that the random Clifford measurements algorithm of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill, which is sample-optimal for mixed states, is not optimal for pure states. Interestingly, our result also uses the same random Clifford measurements but employs a different estimator.</description>

    <title>Transversal Injection: A method for direct encoding of ancilla states for non-Clifford gates using stabiliser codes</title>

    <description>Fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computation is commonly acknowledged to be crucial to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms that could lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected framework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no matter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these gates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three protocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations such as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates: Transversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical states of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states, including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results hint at high quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further research on this technique.</description>

    <title>A (simple) classical algorithm for estimating Betti numbers</title>

    <description>We describe a simple algorithm for estimating the $k$-th normalized Betti number of a simplicial complex over $n$ elements using the path integral Monte Carlo method. For a general simplicial complex, the running time of our algorithm is $n^{O(\frac{1}{\gamma}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ with $\gamma$ measuring the spectral gap of the combinatorial Laplacian and $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ the additive precision. In the case of a clique complex, the running time of our algorithm improves to $(n/\lambda_{\max})^{O(\frac{1}{\gamma}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ with $\lambda_{\max} \geq k$ the maximum eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacian. Our algorithm provides a classical benchmark for a line of quantum algorithms for estimating Betti numbers, and it matches their running time on clique complexes when the spectral gap is constant and $k \in \Omega(n)$ or $\lambda_{\max} \in \Omega(n)$.</description>

    <title>Even shorter quantum circuit for phase estimation on early fault-tolerant quantum computers with applications to ground-state energy estimation</title>

    <description>We develop a phase estimation method with a distinct feature: its maximal runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate. The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. This is different from all previous proposals, where $\delta \gtrsim \pi$ is required even if the initial state is an exact eigenstate. As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin, Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under various settings.</description>

    <title>Digital simulation of non-Abelian anyons with 68 programmable superconducting qubits</title>

    <description>Non-Abelian anyons are exotic quasiparticle excitations hosted by certain topological phases of matter [1-2]. They break the fermion-boson dichotomy and obey non-Abelian braiding statistics [3-5]: their interchanges yield unitary operations, rather than merely a phase factor, in a space spanned by topologically degenerate wavefunctions. They are the building blocks of topological quantum computing [1, 6-9]. However, experimental observation of non-Abelian anyons and their characterizing braiding statistics have remained elusive hitherto, in spite of various theoretical proposals [10-21]. Here, we report such an observation with up to 68 programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a two-dimensional lattice. By implementing the toric-code model with twists through quantum circuits, we demonstrate that twists exchange electric and magnetic charges and behave as a particular type of non-Abelian anyons -- the Ising anyons. In particular, we show experimentally that these anyons follow the fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding statistics of the Ising type, and can indeed be used to encode topological logical qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to implement both single- and two-qubit logical gates through applying a sequence of elementary Pauli gates on the underlying physical qubits and then measuring some nonlocal observables. Our results establish a versatile digital approach to realize and manipulate non-Abelian anyons, thus paving an alternative way to topological quantum computing.</description>

    <title>Closed-form analytic expressions for shadow estimation with brickwork circuits</title>

    <description>Properties of quantum systems can be estimated using classical shadows, which implement measurements based on random ensembles of unitaries. Originally derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of observables supported on sufficiently many qubits.</description>

    <title>An efficient combination of quantum error correction and authentication</title>

    <description>When sending quantum information over a channel, we want to ensure that the message remains intact. Quantum error correction and quantum authentication both aim to protect (quantum) information, but approach this task from two very different directions: error-correcting codes protect against probabilistic channel noise and are meant to be very robust against small errors, while authentication codes prevent adversarial attacks and are designed to be very sensitive against any error, including small ones. In practice, when sending an authenticated state over a noisy channel, one would have to wrap it in an error-correcting code to counterbalance the sensitivity of the underlying authentication scheme. We study the question of whether this can be done more efficiently by combining the two functionalities in a single code. To illustrate the potential of such a combination, we design the threshold code, a modification of the trap authentication code which preserves that code's authentication properties, but which is naturally robust against depolarizing channel noise. We show that the threshold code needs polylogarithmically fewer qubits to achieve the same level of security and robustness, compared to the naive composition of the trap code with any concatenated CSS code. We believe our analysis opens the door to combining more general error-correction and authentication codes, which could improve the practicality of the resulting scheme.</description>

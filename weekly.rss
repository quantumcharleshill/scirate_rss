    <title>A super-polynomial quantum advantage for combinatorial optimization problems</title>

    <description>Combinatorial optimization - a field of research addressing problems that feature strongly in a wealth of practical and industrial contexts - has been identified as one of the core potential fields of applicability of near-term quantum computers. It is still unclear, however, to what extent variational quantum algorithms can actually outperform classical algorithms for this type of problems. In this work, by resorting to computational learning theory and cryptographic notions, we prove that fault-tolerant quantum computers feature a super-polynomial advantage over classical computers in approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, building on seminal work of Kearns and Valiant, we construct special instances of the integer programming problem (which in its most general form is NP-complete) that we prove to be hard-to-approximate classically but give an efficient quantum algorithm to approximate the optimal solution of those instances, hence showing a super-polynomial quantum advantage. This result shows that quantum devices have the power to approximate combinatorial optimization solutions beyond the reach of classical efficient algorithms.</description>

    <title>Noisy Stabilizer Formalism</title>

    <description>Despite the exponential overhead to describe general multi-qubit quantum states and processes, efficient methods for certain state families and operations have been developed and utilised. The stabilizer formalism and the Gottesman-Knill theorem, where pure stabilizer or graph states are manipulated by Clifford operations and Pauli measurements, are prominent examples, and these states play a major role in many applications in quantum technologies. Here we develop a noisy stabilizer formalism, i.e., a method that allows one not only to efficiently describe and follow pure states under Clifford operations and Pauli measurements but also Pauli noise processes acting on such stabilizer states, including uncorrelated and correlated dephasing and single- or multi-qubit depolarizing noise. The method scales linearly in the number of qubits of the initial state, but exponentially in the size of the target state. Thus, whenever a noisy stabilizer state is manipulated by means of local Pauli measurements such that a multipartite entangled state of a few qubits is generated, one can efficiently describe the resulting state.</description>

    <title>A graph-state based synthesis framework for Clifford isometries</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06928</link>

    <description>We tackle the problem of Clifford isometry compilation, i.e, how to synthesize a Clifford isometry into an executable quantum circuit. We propose a simple framework for synthesis that only exploits the elementary properties of the Clifford group and one equation of the symplectic group. We highlight the versatility of our framework by showing that several normal forms of the literature are natural corollaries. We report an improvement of the two-qubit depth necessary for the execution of a Clifford circuit on an LNN architecture. We also apply our framework to the synthesis of graph states and the codiagonalization of Pauli rotations and we improve the 2-qubit count and 2-qubit depth of circuits taken from quantum chemistry experiments.</description>

    <title>Grothendieck inequalities characterize converses to the polynomial method</title>

    <description>A surprising 'converse to the polynomial method' of Aaronson et al. (CCC'16) shows that any bounded quadratic polynomial can be computed exactly in expectation by a 1-query algorithm up to a universal multiplicative factor related to the famous Grothendieck constant. Here we show that such a result does not generalize to quartic polynomials and 2-query algorithms, even when we allow for additive approximations. We also show that the additive approximation implied by their result is tight for bounded bilinear forms, which gives a new characterization of the Grothendieck constant in terms of 1-query quantum algorithms. Along the way we provide reformulations of the completely bounded norm of a form, and its dual norm.</description>

    <title>Upper Bounds on the Distillable Randomness of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09073</link>

    <description>The distillable randomness of a bipartite quantum state is an information-theoretic quantity equal to the largest net rate at which shared randomness can be distilled from the state by means of local operations and classical communication. This quantity has been widely used as a measure of classical correlations, and one version of it is equal to the regularized Holevo information of the ensemble that results from measuring one share of the state. However, due to the regularization, the distillable randomness is difficult to compute in general. To address this problem, we define measures of classical correlations and prove a number of their properties, most importantly that they serve as upper bounds on the distillable randomness of an arbitrary bipartite state. We then further bound these measures from above by some that are efficiently computable by means of semi-definite programming, we evaluate one of them for the example of an isotropic state, and we remark on the relation to quantities previously proposed in the literature.</description>

    <title>From time-reversal symmetry to quantum Bayes' rules</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08088</link>

    <pubDate>Dec 19 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Bayes' rule $\mathbb{P}(B|A)\mathbb{P}(A)=\mathbb{P}(A|B)\mathbb{P}(B)$ is one of the simplest yet most profound, ubiquitous, and far-reaching results of classical probability theory, with applications in decision making, artificial intelligence, weather forecasts, betting strategies, and more generally statistical inference. Many attempts have been made to extend this rule to quantum systems, the significance of which we are only beginning to understand. In this work, we develop a systematic framework for defining Bayes' rule in the quantum setting, and we show that a vast majority of the proposed quantum Bayes' rules appearing in the literature are all instances of our definition. Moreover, our Bayes' rule is based upon a simple relationship between the notions of \emphstate over time and a time-reversal symmetry map, both of which are introduced here.</description>

    <title>Bounds on Renyi entropy growth in many-body quantum systems</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.07444</link>
    <author>Zhengyan Darius Shi</author>
    <pubDate>Dec 16 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We prove rigorous bounds on the growth of $\alpha$-Renyi entropies $S_{\alpha}(t)$ (the Von Neumann entropy being the special case $\alpha = 1$) associated with any subsystem $A$ of a general lattice quantum many-body system with finite onsite Hilbert space dimension. For completely non-local Hamiltonians, we show that the instantaneous growth rates $|S'_{\alpha}(t)|$ (with $\alpha \neq 1$) can be exponentially larger than $|S'_1(t)|$ as a function of the subsystem size $|A|$. For $D$-dimensional systems with geometric locality, we prove bounds on $|S'_{\alpha}(t)|$ that depend on the decay rate of interactions with distance. When $\alpha = 1$, the bound is $|A|$-independent for all power-law decaying interactions $V(r) \sim r^{-w}$ with $w > 2D+1$. But for $\alpha > 1$, the bound is $|A|$-independent only when the interactions are finite-range or decay faster than $V(r) \sim e^{- c\, r^D}$ for some $c$ depending on the local Hilbert space dimension. Using similar arguments, we also prove bounds on $k$-local systems with or without geometric locality. A central theme of this work is that the value of $\alpha$ strongly influences the interplay between locality and entanglement growth. In other words, the Von Neumann entropy and the $\alpha$-Renyi entropies cannot be regarded as proxies for each other in studies of entanglement dynamics. We compare these bounds with analytic and numerical results on Hamiltonians with varying degrees of locality and find concrete examples that almost saturate the bound for non-local dynamics.</description>

    <title>Efficient validation of Boson Sampling from binned photon-number distributions</title>

    <description>In order to substantiate claims of quantum computational advantage, it is crucial to develop efficient methods for validating the experimental data. We propose a test of the correct functioning of a boson sampler with single-photon inputs that is based on how photons distribute among partitions of the output modes. Our method is versatile and encompasses previous validation tests based on bunching phenomena, marginal distributions, and even some suppression laws. We show via theoretical arguments and numerical simulations that binned-mode photon number distributions can be used in practical scenarios to efficiently distinguish ideal boson samplers from those affected by realistic imperfections, especially partial distinguishability of the photons.</description>

    <title>Non-local finite-depth circuits for constructing SPT states and quantum cellular automata</title>

    <description>Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit, is a key question in quantum condensed matter physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. It underpins classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit is made up of unitary gates which are geometrically local. Inspired by the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question with $k$-local gates, i.e. gates that act on no more than $k$ degrees of freedom but are not restricted to be geometrically local. We show that symmetry-protected topological states (SPTs) can be produced by starting with a product state and acting with a finite-depth circuit of symmetric $k$-local gates, and are thus $k$-local trivial. These conclusions apply both to SPTs protected by global symmetries and subsystem symmetries, but seemingly not to higher-form symmetries. We also show that arbitrary translationally-invariant quantum cellular automata on periodic lattices in any dimension can be implemented by finite-depth $k$-local circuits. We conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the feasibility of state preparation and the stability of phases without the assumption of geometric locality and has broad implications for condensed matter physics, quantum information, and quantum computation.</description>

    <title>Classically Simulating Quantum Supremacy IQP Circuits trough a Random Graph Approach</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08609</link>
    <author>Julien Codsi, John van de Wetering</author>

    <description>Quantum Supremacy is a demonstration of a computation by a quantum computer that can not be performed by the best classical computer in a reasonable time. A well-studied approach to demonstrating this on near-term quantum computers is to use random circuit sampling. It has been suggested that a good candidate for demonstrating quantum supremacy with random circuit sampling is to use \emphIQP circuits. These are quantum circuits where the unitary it implements is diagonal. In this paper we introduce improved techniques for classically simulating random IQP circuits. We find a simple algorithm to calculate an amplitude of an $n$-qubit IQP circuit with dense random two-qubit interactions in time $O(\frac{\log^2 n}{n} 2^n )$, which for sparse circuits (where each qubit interacts with $O(\log n)$ other qubits) runs in $o(2^n/\text{poly}(n))$ for any given polynomial. Using a more complicated stabiliser decomposition approach we improve the algorithm for dense circuits to $O\left(\frac{(\log n)^{4-\beta}}{n^{2-\beta}} 2^n \right)$ where $\beta \approx 0.396$. We benchmarked our algorithm and found that we can simulate up to 50-qubit circuits in a couple of minutes on a laptop. We estimate that 70-qubit circuits are within reach for a large computing cluster.</description>

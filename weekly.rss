    <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Quantum Verification</title>

    <description>We initiate the study of parameterized complexity of $\textsf{QMA}$ problems in terms of the number of non-Clifford gates in the problem description. We show that for the problem of parameterized quantum circuit satisfiability, there exists a classical algorithm solving the problem with a runtime scaling exponentially in the number of non-Clifford gates but only polynomially with the system size. This result follows from our main result, that for any Clifford + $t$ $T$-gate quantum circuit satisfiability problem, the search space of optimal witnesses can be reduced to a stabilizer subspace isomorphic to at most $t$ qubits (independent of the system size). Furthermore, we derive new lower bounds on the $T$-count of circuit satisfiability instances and the $T$-count of the $W$-state assuming the classical exponential time hypothesis ($\textsf{ETH}$). Lastly, we explore the parameterized complexity of the quantum non-identity check problem.</description>

    <description>Understanding quantum channels and the strange behavior of their capacities is a key objective of quantum information theory. Here we study a remarkably simple, low-dimensional, single-parameter family of quantum channels with exotic quantum information-theoretic features. As the simplest example from this family, we focus on a qutrit-to-qutrit channel that is intuitively obtained by hybridizing together a simple degradable channel and a completely useless qubit channel. Such hybridizing makes this channel's capacities behave in a variety of interesting ways. For instance, the private and classical capacity of this channel coincide and can be explicitly calculated, even though the channel does not belong to any class for which the underlying information quantities are known to be additive. Moreover, the quantum capacity of the channel can be computed explicitly, given a clear and compelling conjecture is true. This "spin alignment conjecture", which may be of independent interest, is proved in certain special cases and additional numerical evidence for its validity is provided. Finally, we generalize the qutrit channel in two ways, and the resulting channels and their capacities display similarly rich behavior. In a companion paper, we further show that the qutrit channel demonstrates superadditivity when transmitting quantum information jointly with a variety of assisting channels, in a manner unknown before.</description>

    <title>Scrambling Dynamics and Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators in Quantum Many-Body Systems: a Tutorial</title>

    <pubDate>Feb 16 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This tutorial article introduces the physics of quantum information scrambling in quantum many-body systems. The goals are to understand how to quantify the spreading of quantum information precisely and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce the general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, in certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-the-time ordered correlator (OTOC). The general behavior of OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, both exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experiment schemes to measure OTOC in various quantum simulators.</description>

    <title>Generic nonadditivity of quantum capacity in simple channels</title>

    <description>Determining capacities of quantum channels is a fundamental question in quantum information theory. Despite having rigorous coding theorems quantifying the flow of information across quantum channels, their capacities are poorly understood due to super-additivity effects. Studying these phenomena is important for deepening our understanding of quantum information, yet simple and clean examples of super-additive channels are scarce. Here we study a simple family of qutrit channels called the platypus channel, and show that it exhibits super-additivity of coherent information when used jointly with a variety of qubit channels. A higher-dimensional variant of the platypus channel displays super-additivity of quantum capacity together with an erasure channel. Subject to the "spin-alignment conjecture" introduced in a companion paper, our results on super-additivity of quantum capacity extend to lower-dimensional channels as well as larger parameter ranges. In particular, super-additivity occurs between two weakly additive channels each with large capacity on their own, in stark contrast to previous results. Remarkably, a single, novel transmission strategy achieves super-additivity in all examples. Our results show that super-additivity is much more prevalent than previously thought. It can occur across a wide variety of channels, even when both participating channels have large quantum capacity.</description>

    <title>Circuit Extraction for ZX-diagrams can be #P-hard</title>

    <description>The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computation using ZX-diagrams, a certain flexible generalisation of quantum circuits that can be used to represent linear maps from $m$ to $n$ qubits for any $m,n \geq 0$. Some applications for the ZX-calculus, such as quantum circuit optimisation and synthesis, rely on being able to efficiently translate a ZX-diagram back into a quantum circuit of comparable size. While several sufficient conditions are known for describing families of ZX-diagrams that can be efficiently transformed back into circuits, it has previously been conjectured that the general problem of circuit extraction is hard. That is, that it should not be possible to efficiently convert an arbitrary ZX-diagram describing a unitary linear map into an equivalent quantum circuit. In this paper we prove this conjecture by showing that the circuit extraction problem is #P-hard, and so is itself at least as hard as strong simulation of quantum circuits. In addition to our main hardness result, which relies specifically on the circuit representation, we give a representation-agnostic hardness result. Namely, we show that any oracle that takes as input a ZX-diagram description of a unitary and produces samples of the output of the associated quantum computation enables efficient probabilistic solutions to NP-complete problems.</description>

    <title>Optimizing quantum circuits with Riemannian gradient-flow</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06976</link>

    <pubDate>Feb 16 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Variational quantum algorithms are a promising class of algorithms that can be performed on currently available quantum computers. In most settings, the free parameters of a variational circuit are optimized using a classical optimizer that updates parameters in Euclidean geometry. Since quantum circuits are elements of the special unitary group, we can consider an alternative optimization perspective that depends on the structure of this group. In this work, we investigate a Riemannian optimization scheme over the special unitary group and we discuss its implementation on a quantum computer. We illustrate that the resulting Riemannian gradient-flow algorithm has favorable optimization properties for deep circuits and that an approximate version of this algorithm can be performed on near-term hardware.</description>

    <title>Quantifying dynamical magic with completely stabilizer preserving operations as free</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07867</link>
    <author>Gaurav Saxena, Gilad Gour</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 17 2022</pubDate>
    <description>In this paper, we extend the resource theory of magic to the channel case by considering completely stabilizer preserving operations (CSPOs) as free. We introduce and characterize the set of CSPO preserving and completely CSPO preserving superchannels. We quantify the magic of quantum channels by extending the generalized robustness and the min relative entropy of magic from the state to the channel domain and show that they bound the single-shot dynamical magic cost and distillation. We also provide analytical conditions for qubit interconversion under CSPOs and show that it is a linear programming feasibility problem and hence can be efficiently solved. Lastly, we give a classical simulation algorithm whose runtime is related to the generalized robustness of magic for channels. Our algorithm depends on some pre-defined precision, and if there is no bound on the desired precision then it achieves a constant runtime.</description>

    <title>Approximating Output Probabilities of Shallow Quantum Circuits which are Geometrically-local in any Fixed Dimension</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08349</link>

    <description>We present a classical algorithm that, for any $D$-dimensional geometrically-local, quantum circuit $C$ of polylogarithmic-depth, and any bit string $x \in {0,1}^n$, can compute the quantity $|<x|C|0^{\otimes n}>|^2$ to within any inverse-polynomial additive error in quasi-polynomial time, for any fixed dimension $D$. This is an extension of the result [CC21], which originally proved this result for $D = 3$. To see why this is interesting, note that, while the $D = 1$ case of this result follows from standard use of Matrix Product States, known for decades, the $D = 2$ case required novel and interesting techniques introduced in [BGM19]. Extending to the case $D = 3$ was even more laborious and required further new techniques introduced in [CC21]. Our work here shows that, while handling each new dimension has historically required a new insight, and fixed algorithmic primitive, based on known techniques for $D \leq 3$, we can now handle any fixed dimension $D > 3$. Our algorithm uses the Divide-and-Conquer framework of [CC21] to approximate the desired quantity via several instantiations of the same problem type, each involving $D$-dimensional circuits on about half the number of qubits as the original. This division step is then applied recursively, until the width of the recursively decomposed circuits in the $D^{th}$ dimension is so small that they can effectively be regarded as $(D-1)$-dimensional problems by absorbing the small width in the $D^{th}$ dimension into the qudit structure at the cost of a moderate increase in runtime. The main technical challenge lies in ensuring that the more involved portions of the recursive circuit decomposition and error analysis from [CC21] still hold in higher dimensions, which requires small modifications to the analysis in some places.</description>

    <title>State Preparation Boosters for Early Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06978</link>

    <description>Quantum computing is believed to be particularly useful for the simulation of chemistry and materials, among the various applications. In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the development of near-term quantum algorithms for quantum simulation, including VQE and many of its variants. However, for such algorithms to be useful, they need to overcome several critical barriers including the inability to prepare high-quality approximations of the ground state. Current challenges to state preparation, including barren plateaus and the high-dimensionality of the optimization landscape, make state preparation through ansatz optimization unreliable. In this work, we introduce the method of ground state boosting, which uses a limited-depth quantum circuit to reliably increase the overlap with the ground state. This circuit, which we call a booster, can be used to augment an ansatz from VQE or be used as a stand-alone state preparation method. The booster converts circuit depth into ground state overlap in a controllable manner. We numerically demonstrate the capabilities of boosters by simulating the performance of a particular type of booster, namely the Gaussian booster, for preparing the ground state of $N_2$ molecular system. Beyond ground state preparation as a direct objective, many quantum algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation, rely on high-quality state preparation as a subroutine. Therefore, we foresee ground state boosting and similar methods as becoming essential algorithmic components as the field transitions into using early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

    <title>Classical simulation of quantum circuits with partial and graphical stabiliser decompositions</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09202</link>

    <description>Recent developments in classical simulation of quantum circuits make use of clever decompositions of chunks of magic states into sums of efficiently simulable stabiliser states. We show here how, by considering certain non-stabiliser entangled states which have more favourable decompositions, we can speed up these simulations. This is made possible by using the ZX-calculus, which allows us to easily find instances of these entangled states in the simplified diagram representing the quantum circuit to be simulated. We additionally find a new technique of partial stabiliser decompositions that allow us to trade magic states for stabiliser terms. With this technique we require only $2^{\alpha t}$ stabiliser terms, where $\alpha\approx 0.396$, to simulate a circuit with T-count $t$. This matches the $\alpha$ found by Qassim et al., but whereas they only get this scaling in the asymptotic limit, ours applies for a circuit of any size. Our method builds upon a recently proposed scheme for simulation combining stabiliser decompositions and optimisation strategies implemented in the software QuiZX. With our techniques we manage to reliably simulate 50-qubit 1400 T-count hidden shift circuits in a couple of minutes on a consumer laptop.</description>

    <title>A mathematical framework for quantum Hamiltonian simulation and duality</title>

    <description>Analogue Hamiltonian simulation is a promising near-term application of quantum computing and has recently been put on a theoretical footing. In Hamiltonian simulation, a physical Hamiltonian is engineered to have identical physics to another - often very different - Hamiltonian. This is qualitatively similar to the notion of duality in physics, whereby two superficially different theories are mathematically equivalent in some precise sense. However, existing characterisations of Hamiltonian simulations are not sufficiently general to extend to all dualities in physics. In particular, they cannot encompass the important cases of strong/weak and high-temperature/low-temperature dualities. In this work, we give three physically motivated axiomatisations of duality, formulated respectively in terms of observables, partition functions and entropies. We prove that these axiomatisations are equivalent, and characterise the mathematical form that any duality satisfying these axioms must take. A building block in one of our results is a strengthening of earlier results on entropy-preserving maps to maps that are entropy-preserving up to an additive constant, which we prove decompose as a direct sum of unitary and anti-unitary components, which may be of independent mathematical interest.</description>

    <title>Exponential concentration and untrainability in quantum kernel methods</title>

    <description>Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum advantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from a quantum hardware. In this work we study the trainability of quantum kernels from the perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards some fixed value, leading to an exponential scaling of the number of measurements required for successful training. We identify four sources that can lead to concentration including: the expressibility of data embedding, global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation and the trainability of quantum kernel methods.</description>

    <title>Resource theory of quantum scrambling</title>

    <description>Quantum scrambling refers to the spread of local quantum information into the many degrees of freedom of a quantum system. In this work, we introduce a resource theory of scrambling which incorporates two mechanisms, "entanglement scrambling" and "magic scrambling". We introduce two resource monotones called the Pauli growth and the OTOC (out-of-time-ordered correlator) magic for these two mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, we show that OTOC fluctuations are bounded by the OTOC magic. This proves that small OTOC fluctuations are an indication of magic in Google's recent experiment (Science 374, 1479 (2021)). We also show that both resource monotones can be used to bound the decoding fidelity in the Hayden-Preskill protocol. These applications provide an operational interpretation of the resource monotones defined in this work.</description>

    <title>Alternating Layered Variational Quantum Circuits Can Be Classically Optimized Efficiently Using Classical Shadows</title>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are the quantum analog of classical neural networks (NNs). A VQA consists of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) which is composed of multiple layers of ansatzes (simpler PQCs, which are an analogy of NN layers) that differ only in selections of parameters. Previous work has identified the alternating layered ansatz as potentially a new standard ansatz in near-term quantum computing. Indeed, shallow alternating layered VQAs are easy to implement and have been shown to be both trainable and expressive. In this work, we introduce a training algorithm with an exponential reduction in training cost of such VQAs. Moreover, our algorithm uses classical shadows of quantum input data, and can hence be run on a classical computer with rigorous performance guarantees. We demonstrate 2--3 orders of magnitude improvement in the training cost using our algorithm for the example problems of finding state preparation circuits and the quantum autoencoder.</description>

    <title>No [[n, k, d < 86]] code can violate the quantum Hamming bound</title>

    <description>It is well-known that pure quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) are constrained by a quantum version of the Hamming bound. Whether impure codes also obey such a bound, however, remains a long-standing question with practical implications for the efficacy of QECCs. We employ a combination of previously derived bounds on QECCs to demonstrate that a subset of all codes must obey the quantum Hamming bound. Specifically, we combine an analytical bound due to Rains with a numerical bound due to Li and Xing to show that no [[n,k,d < 86]] code can violate the quantum Hamming bound.</description>

    <title>A SAT Encoding for Optimal Clifford Circuit Synthesis</title>

    <description>Executing quantum algorithms on a quantum computer requires compilation to representations that conform to all restrictions imposed by the device. Due to device's limited coherence times and gate fidelities, the compilation process has to be optimized as much as possible. To this end, an algorithm's description first has to be synthesized using the device's gate library. In this paper, we consider the optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits -- an important subclass of quantum circuits, with various applications. Such techniques are essential to establish lower bounds for (heuristic) synthesis methods and gauging their performance. Due to the huge search space, existing optimal techniques are limited to a maximum of six qubits. The contribution of this work is twofold: First, we propose an optimal synthesis method for Clifford circuits based on encoding the task as a satisfiability (SAT) problem and solving it using a SAT solver in conjunction with a binary search scheme. The resulting tool is demonstrated to synthesize optimal circuits for up to $26$ qubits -- more than four times as many as the current state of the art. Second, we experimentally show that the overhead introduced by state-of-the-art heuristics exceeds the lower bound by $27\%$ on average. The resulting tool is publicly available at https://github.com/cda-tum/qmap.</description>

    <title>Efficient algorithms for quantum information bottleneck</title>

    <description>The ability to extract relevant information is critical to learning. An ingenious approach as such is the information bottleneck, an optimisation problem whose solution corresponds to a faithful and memory-efficient representation of relevant information from a large system. The advent of the age of quantum computing calls for efficient methods that work on information regarding quantum systems. Here we address this by proposing a new and general algorithm for the quantum generalisation of information bottleneck. Our algorithm excels in the speed and the definiteness of convergence compared with prior results. It also works for a much broader range of problems, including the quantum extension of deterministic information bottleneck, an important variant of the original information bottleneck problem. Notably, we discover that a quantum system can achieve strictly better performance than a classical system of the same size regarding quantum information bottleneck, providing new vision on justifying the advantage of quantum machine learning.</description>

    <title>No graph states can be prepared in quantum networks with bipartite sources</title>

    <description>In research concerning quantum networks, it is often assumed that the parties can classically communicate with each other. However, classical communication might introduce substantial delay to the network, especially if it is large. As the latency of a network is one of its most important characteristics, it is interesting to consider quantum networks in which parties cannot communicate classically and ask what limitations this assumption imposes on the possibility of preparing multipartite states in such networks. We show that graph states of arbitrary prime local dimension known for their numerous applications in quantum information cannot be generated in a quantum network in which parties are connected via sources of bipartite quantum states and the classical communication is replaced by some pre-shared classical correlations. We then generalise our result to arbitrary quantum states that are sufficiently close to graph states.</description>

    <title>Variational quantum iterative power algorithms for global optimization</title>

    <description>We introduce a family of variational quantum algorithms called quantum iterative power algorithms (QIPA) that outperform existing hybrid near-term quantum algorithms of the same kind. We demonstrate the capabilities of QIPA as applied to three different global-optimization numerical experiments: the ground-state optimization of the $H_2$ molecular dissociation, search of the transmon qubit ground-state, and biprime factorization. Since our algorithm is hybrid, quantum/classical technologies such as error mitigation and adaptive variational ansatzes can easily be incorporated into the algorithm. Due to the shallow quantum circuit requirements, we anticipate large-scale implementation and adoption of the proposed algorithm across current major quantum hardware.</description>

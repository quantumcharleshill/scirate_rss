    <description>The ambition of harnessing the quantum for computation is at odds with the fundamental phenomenon of decoherence. The purpose of quantum error correction (QEC) is to counteract the natural tendency of a complex system to decohere. This cooperative process, which requires participation of multiple quantum and classical components, creates a special type of dissipation that removes the entropy caused by the errors faster than the rate at which these errors corrupt the stored quantum information. Previous experimental attempts to engineer such a process faced an excessive generation of errors that overwhelmed the error-correcting capability of the process itself. Whether it is practically possible to utilize QEC for extending quantum coherence thus remains an open question. We answer it by demonstrating a fully stabilized and error-corrected logical qubit whose quantum coherence is significantly longer than that of all the imperfect quantum components involved in the QEC process, beating the best of them with a coherence gain of $G = 2.27 \pm 0.07$. We achieve this performance by combining innovations in several domains including the fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits and model-free reinforcement learning.</description>

    <description>Quantum dynamics can be simulated on a quantum computer by exponentiating elementary terms from the Hamiltonian in a sequential manner. However, such an implementation of Trotter steps has gate complexity depending on the total Hamiltonian term number, comparing unfavorably to algorithms using more advanced techniques. We develop methods to perform faster Trotter steps with complexity sublinear in the number of terms. We achieve this for a class of Hamiltonians whose interaction strength decays with distance according to power law. Our methods include one based on a recursive block encoding and one based on an average-cost simulation, overcoming the normalization-factor barrier of these advanced quantum simulation techniques. We also realize faster Trotter steps when certain blocks of Hamiltonian coefficients have low rank. Combining with a tighter error analysis, we show that it suffices to use $\left(\eta^{1/3}n^{1/3}+\frac{n^{2/3}}{\eta^{2/3}}\right)n^{1+o(1)}$ gates to simulate uniform electron gas with $n$ spin orbitals and $\eta$ electrons in second quantization in real space, asymptotically improving over the best previous work. We obtain an analogous result when the external potential of nuclei is introduced under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We prove a circuit lower bound when the Hamiltonian coefficients take a continuum range of values, showing that generic $n$-qubit $2$-local Hamiltonians with commuting terms require at least $\Omega(n^2)$ gates to evolve with accuracy $\epsilon=\Omega(1/poly(n))$ for time $t=\Omega(\epsilon)$. Our proof is based on a gate-efficient reduction from the approximate synthesis of diagonal unitaries within the Hamming weight-$2$ subspace, which may be of independent interest. Our result thus suggests the use of Hamiltonian structural properties as both necessary and sufficient to implement Trotter steps with lower gate complexity.</description>

    <description>Fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computation is commonly acknowledged to be crucial to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms that could lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected framework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no matter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these gates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three protocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations such as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates: Transversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical states of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states, including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results hint at high quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further research on this technique.</description>

    <title>A (simple) classical algorithm for estimating Betti numbers</title>

    <description>We describe a simple algorithm for estimating the $k$-th normalized Betti number of a simplicial complex over $n$ elements using the path integral Monte Carlo method. For a general simplicial complex, the running time of our algorithm is $n^{O(\frac{1}{\gamma}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ with $\gamma$ measuring the spectral gap of the combinatorial Laplacian and $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ the additive precision. In the case of a clique complex, the running time of our algorithm improves to $(n/\lambda_{\max})^{O(\frac{1}{\gamma}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ with $\lambda_{\max} \geq k$ the maximum eigenvalue of the combinatorial Laplacian. Our algorithm provides a classical benchmark for a line of quantum algorithms for estimating Betti numbers, and it matches their running time on clique complexes when the spectral gap is constant and $k \in \Omega(n)$ or $\lambda_{\max} \in \Omega(n)$.</description>

    <title>Adaptive surface code for quantum error correction in the presence of temporary or permanent defects</title>

    <description>Whether it is at the fabrication stage or during the course of the quantum computation, e.g. because of high-energy events like cosmic rays, the qubits constituting an error correcting code may be rendered inoperable. Such defects may correspond to individual qubits or to clusters and could potentially disrupt the code sufficiently to generate logical errors. In this paper, we explore a novel adaptive approach for surface code quantum error correction on a defective lattice. We show that combining an appropriate defect detection algorithm and a quarantine of the identified zone allows one to preserve the advantage of quantum error correction at finite code sizes, at the cost of a qubit overhead that scales with the size of the defect. Our numerics indicate that the code's threshold need not be significantly affected; for example, for a certain scenario where small defects repeatedly arise in each logical qubit, the noise threshold is $2.7\%$ (versus the defect-free case of $2.9\%$). These results pave the way to the experimental implementation of large-scale quantum computers where defects will be inevitable.</description>

    <title>Digital simulation of non-Abelian anyons with 68 programmable superconducting qubits</title>

    <description>Non-Abelian anyons are exotic quasiparticle excitations hosted by certain topological phases of matter [1-2]. They break the fermion-boson dichotomy and obey non-Abelian braiding statistics [3-5]: their interchanges yield unitary operations, rather than merely a phase factor, in a space spanned by topologically degenerate wavefunctions. They are the building blocks of topological quantum computing [1, 6-9]. However, experimental observation of non-Abelian anyons and their characterizing braiding statistics have remained elusive hitherto, in spite of various theoretical proposals [10-21]. Here, we report such an observation with up to 68 programmable superconducting qubits arranged on a two-dimensional lattice. By implementing the toric-code model with twists through quantum circuits, we demonstrate that twists exchange electric and magnetic charges and behave as a particular type of non-Abelian anyons -- the Ising anyons. In particular, we show experimentally that these anyons follow the fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding statistics of the Ising type, and can indeed be used to encode topological logical qubits. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to implement both single- and two-qubit logical gates through applying a sequence of elementary Pauli gates on the underlying physical qubits and then measuring some nonlocal observables. Our results establish a versatile digital approach to realize and manipulate non-Abelian anyons, thus paving an alternative way to topological quantum computing.</description>

    <title>Closed-form analytic expressions for shadow estimation with brickwork circuits</title>

    <description>Properties of quantum systems can be estimated using classical shadows, which implement measurements based on random ensembles of unitaries. Originally derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of observables supported on sufficiently many qubits.</description>

    <title>An efficient combination of quantum error correction and authentication</title>

    <description>When sending quantum information over a channel, we want to ensure that the message remains intact. Quantum error correction and quantum authentication both aim to protect (quantum) information, but approach this task from two very different directions: error-correcting codes protect against probabilistic channel noise and are meant to be very robust against small errors, while authentication codes prevent adversarial attacks and are designed to be very sensitive against any error, including small ones. In practice, when sending an authenticated state over a noisy channel, one would have to wrap it in an error-correcting code to counterbalance the sensitivity of the underlying authentication scheme. We study the question of whether this can be done more efficiently by combining the two functionalities in a single code. To illustrate the potential of such a combination, we design the threshold code, a modification of the trap authentication code which preserves that code's authentication properties, but which is naturally robust against depolarizing channel noise. We show that the threshold code needs polylogarithmically fewer qubits to achieve the same level of security and robustness, compared to the naive composition of the trap code with any concatenated CSS code. We believe our analysis opens the door to combining more general error-correction and authentication codes, which could improve the practicality of the resulting scheme.</description>

    <title>Error bounds for Lie Group representations in quantum mechanics</title>

    <description>We provide state-dependent error bounds for strongly continuous unitary representations of connected Lie groups. That is, we bound the difference of two unitaries applied to a state in terms of the energy with respect to a reference Hamiltonian associated to the representation and a left-invariant metric distance on the group. Our method works for any connected Lie group and the metric is independent of the chosen representation. The approach also applies to projective representations and allows us to provide bounds on the energy constrained diamond norm distance of any suitably continuous channel representation of the group.</description>

    <title>Magic of Random Matrix Product States</title>

    <description>Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing. In this paper, we study the magic of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) by the $L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm. We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the $1$D RMPS is highly magical. Our numerical results confirm that the magic grows exponentially in the qubit case.</description>

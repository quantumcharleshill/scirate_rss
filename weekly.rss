    <description>The complexity of a quantum gate, defined as the minimal number of elementary gates to build it, is an important concept in quantum information and computation. It is shown recently that the complexity of quantum gates built from random quantum circuits almost surely grows linearly with the number of building blocks. In this article, we provide two short proofs of this fact. We also discuss a discrete version of quantum circuit complexity growth.</description>

    <description>Variational quantum machine learning is an extensively studied application of near-term quantum computers. The success of variational quantum learning models crucially depends on finding a suitable parametrization of the model that encodes an inductive bias relevant to the learning task. However, precious little is known about guiding principles for the construction of suitable parametrizations. In this work, we holistically explore when and how symmetries of the learning problem can be exploited to construct quantum learning models with outcomes invariant under the symmetry of the learning task. Building on tools from representation theory, we show how a standard gateset can be transformed into an equivariant gateset that respects the symmetries of the problem at hand through a process of gate symmetrization. We benchmark the proposed methods on two toy problems that feature a non-trivial symmetry and observe a substantial increase in generalization performance. As our tools can also be applied in a straightforward way to other variational problems with symmetric structure, we show how equivariant gatesets can be used in variational quantum eigensolvers.</description>

    <title>Beyond Barren Plateaus: Quantum Variational Algorithms Are Swamped With Traps</title>

    <description>One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models -- which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateus -- have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.</description>

    <title>Learning quantum graph states with product measurements</title>

    <description>We consider the problem of learning $N$ identical copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum graph state with product measurements. These graph states have corresponding graphs where every vertex has exactly $d$ neighboring vertices. Here, we detail an explicit algorithm that uses product measurements on multiple identical copies of such graph states to learn them. When $n \gg d$ and $N = O(d \log(1/\epsilon) + d^2 \log n ),$ this algorithm correctly learns the graph state with probability at least $1- \epsilon$. From channel coding theory, we find that for arbitrary joint measurements on graph states, any learning algorithm achieving this accuracy requires at least $\Omega(\log (1/\epsilon) + d \log n)$ copies when $d=o(\sqrt n)$. We also supply bounds on $N$ when every graph state encounters identical and independent depolarizing errors on each qubit.</description>

    <title>Multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP): prophecies of the two-headed oracle</title>

    <description>Recent work shows that quantum signal processing (QSP) and its multi-qubit lifted version, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), unify and improve the presentation of most quantum algorithms. QSP/QSVT characterize the ability, by alternating ansätze, to obliviously transform the singular values of subsystems of unitary matrices by polynomial functions; these algorithms are numerically stable and analytically well-understood. That said, QSP/QSVT require consistent access to a single oracle, and say nothing about computing joint properties of two or more oracles; these can be far cheaper to compute given the ability to pit oracles against one another coherently. This work introduces a corresponding theory of QSP over multiple variables: M-QSP. Surprisingly, despite the non-existence of the fundamental theorem of algebra for multivariable polynomials, there exist necessary and sufficient conditions under which a desired stable multivariable polynomial transformation is possible. Moreover, the classical subroutines used by QSP protocols survive in the multivariable setting for non-obvious reasons. Up to a well-defined conjecture, we give proof that the family of achievable multivariable transforms is as loosely constrained as could be expected. M-QSP is numerically stable and inherits the approximative efficiency of its single-variable analogue; however, its underlying theory is substantively more complex. M-QSP provides one bridge from quantum algorithms to a rich theory of algebraic geometry over multiple variables. The unique ability of M-QSP to obliviously approximate joint functions of multiple variables coherently leads to novel speedups incommensurate with those of other quantum algorithms.</description>

    <title>The QAOA with Slow Measurements</title>

    <description>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) was originally developed to solve combinatorial optimization problems, but has become a standard for assessing the performance of quantum computers. Fully descriptive benchmarking techniques are often prohibitively expensive for large numbers of qubits ($n \gtrsim 10$), so the QAOA often serves in practice as a computational benchmark. The QAOA involves a classical optimization subroutine that attempts to find optimal parameters for a quantum subroutine. Unfortunately, many optimizers used for the QAOA require many shots ($N \gtrsim 1000$) per point in parameter space to get a reliable estimate of the energy being minimized. However, some experimental quantum computing platforms such as neutral atom quantum computers have slow repetition rates, placing unique requirements on the classical optimization subroutine used in the QAOA in these systems. In this paper we investigate the performance of a gradient free classical optimizer for the QAOA - dual annealing - and demonstrate that optimization is possible even with $N=1$ and $n=16$.</description>

    <title>Exact solution for the quantum and private capacities of bosonic dephasing channels</title>

    <description>The capacities of noisy quantum channels capture the ultimate rates of information transmission across quantum communication lines, and the quantum capacity plays a key role in determining the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation platforms. In the case of bosonic systems, central to many applications, no closed formulas for these capacities were known for bosonic dephasing channels, a key class of non-Gaussian channels modelling, e.g., noise affecting superconducting circuits or fiber-optic communication channels. Here we provide the first exact calculation of the quantum, private, two-way assisted quantum, and secret-key agreement capacities of all bosonic dephasing channels. We prove that that they are equal to the relative entropy of the distribution underlying the channel to the uniform distribution. Our result solves a problem that has been open for over a decade, having been posed originally by [Jiang & Chen, Quantum and Nonlinear Optics 244, 2010].</description>

    <title>Equivariant quantum circuits for learning on weighted graphs</title>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidate for near-term advantage on noisy quantum hardware. When training a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a specific task, the choice of ansatz is one of the most important factors that determines the trainability and performance of the algorithm. Problem-tailored ansatzes have become the standard for tasks in optimization or quantum chemistry, and yield more efficient algorithms with better performance than unstructured approaches. In quantum machine learning (QML), however, the literature on ansatzes that are motivated by the training data structure is scarce. Considering that it is widely known that unstructured ansatzes can become untrainable with increasing system size and circuit depth, it is of key importance to also study problem-tailored circuit architectures in a QML context. In this work, we introduce an ansatz for learning tasks on weighted graphs that respects an important graph symmetry, namely equivariance under node permutations. We evaluate the performance of this ansatz on a complex learning task on weighted graphs, where a ML model is used to implement a heuristic for a combinatorial optimization problem. We analytically study the expressivity of our ansatz at depth one, and numerically compare the performance of our model on instances with up to 20 qubits to ansatzes where the equivariance property is gradually broken. We show that our ansatz outperforms all others even in the small-instance regime. Our results strengthen the notion that symmetry-preserving ansatzes are a key to success in QML and should be an active area of research in order to enable near-term advantages in this field.</description>

    <title>Stabilizer Inactivation for Message-Passing Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06125</link>
    <author>Julien du Crest, Mehdi Mhalla, Valentin Savin</author>
    <pubDate>May 13 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We propose a post-processing method for message-passing (MP) decoding of CSS quantum LDPC codes, called stabilizer-inactivation (SI). It relies on inactivating a set of qubits, supporting a check in the dual code, and then running the MP decoding again. This allows MP decoding to converge outside the inactivated set of qubits, while the error on these is determined by solving a small, constant size, linear system. Compared to the state of the art post-processing method based on ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we show through numerical simulations that MP-SI outperforms MP-OSD for different quantum LDPC code constructions, different MP decoding algorithms, and different MP scheduling strategies, while having a significantly reduced complexity.</description>

    <title>Hay from the haystack: explicit examples of exponential quantum circuit complexity</title>

    <description>The vast majority of quantum states and unitaries have circuit complexity exponential in the number of qubits. In a similar vein, most of them also have exponential minimum description length, which makes it difficult to pinpoint examples of exponential complexity. In this work, we construct examples of constant description length but exponential circuit complexity. We provide infinite families such that each element requires an exponential number of two-qubit gates to be generated exactly from a product and where the same is true for the approximate generation of the vast majority of elements in the family. The results are based on sets of large transcendence degree and discussed for tensor networks, diagonal unitaries, and maximally coherent states.</description>

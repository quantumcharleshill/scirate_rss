    <title>The XP Stabiliser Formalism: a Generalisation of the Pauli Stabiliser Formalism with Arbitrary Phases</title>

    <description>We propose an extension to the Pauli stabiliser formalism that includes fractional $2\pi/N$ rotations around the $Z$ axis for some integer $N$. The resulting generalised stabiliser formalism - denoted the XP stabiliser formalism - allows for a wider range of states and codespaces to be represented. We describe the states which arise in the formalism, and demonstrate an equivalence between XP stabiliser states and 'weighted hypergraph states' - a generalisation of both hypergraph and weighted graph states. Given an arbitrary set of XP operators, we present algorithms for determining the codespace and logical operators for an XP code. Finally, we consider whether measurements of XP operators on XP codes can be classically simulated.</description>

    <title>Quantum Tanner codes</title>

    <description>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</description>

    <title>Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time</title>

    <description>In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984], [arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of total time complexity of both the client and the server, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be verified, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082]. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in \{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side isometry), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$ time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].</description>

    <title>Is quantum advantage the right goal for quantum machine learning?</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01340</link>
    <author>Maria Schuld, Nathan Killoran</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 04 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Machine learning is frequently listed among the most promising applications for quantum computing. This is in fact a curious choice: Today's machine learning algorithms are notoriously powerful in practice, but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales, and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and the narrative of "beating" classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature the way it does, and provide a few examples for alternative research questions.</description>

    <title>Influence in Completely Bounded Block-multilinear Forms and Classical Simulation of Quantum Algorithms</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00212</link>
    <author>Nikhil Bansal, Makrand Sinha, Ronald de Wolf</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 02 2022</pubDate>
    <description>The Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture (Theory of Computing '14) says that every low-degree bounded polynomial on the Boolean hypercube has an influential variable. This conjecture, if true, would imply that the acceptance probability of every $d$-query quantum algorithm can be well-approximated almost everywhere (i.e., on almost all inputs) by a $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-query classical algorithm. We prove a special case of the conjecture: in every completely bounded degree-$d$ block-multilinear form with constant variance, there always exists a variable with influence at least $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$. In a certain sense, such polynomials characterize the acceptance probability of quantum query algorithms, as shown by Arunachalam, Briët and Palazuelos (SICOMP '19). As a corollary we obtain efficient classical almost-everywhere simulation for a particular class of quantum algorithms that includes for instance $k$-fold Forrelation. Our main technical result relies on connections to free probability theory.</description>

    <title>The quantum low-rank approximation problem</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00811</link>
    <author>Nic Ezzell, Zoë Holmes, Patrick J. Coles</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 03 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We consider a quantum version of the famous low-rank approximation problem. Specifically, we consider the distance $D(\rho,\sigma)$ between two normalized quantum states, $\rho$ and $\sigma$, where the rank of $\sigma$ is constrained to be at most $R$. For both the trace distance and Hilbert-Schmidt distance, we analytically solve for the optimal state $\sigma$ that minimizes this distance. For the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, the unique optimal state is $\sigma = \tau_R +N_R$, where $\tau_R = \Pi_R \rho \Pi_R$ is given by projecting $\rho$ onto its $R$ principal components with projector $\Pi_R$, and $N_R$ is a normalization factor given by $N_R = \frac{1- \text{Tr}(\tau_R)}{R}\Pi_R$. For the trace distance, this state is also optimal but not uniquely optimal, and we provide the full set of states that are optimal. We briefly discuss how our results have application for performing principal component analysis (PCA) via variational optimization on quantum computers.</description>

    <title>Optimizing thermalizations</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12616</link>
    <author>Kamil Korzekwa, Matteo Lostaglio</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 28 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We present a rigorous approach, based on the concept of continuous thermomajorisation, to algorithmically characterise the full set of energy occupations of a quantum system accessible from a given initial state through weak interactions with a heat bath. The algorithm can be deployed to solve complex optimization problems in out-of-equilibrium setups and it returns explicit elementary control sequences realizing optimal transformations. We illustrate this by finding optimal protocols in the context of cooling, work extraction and catalysis. The same tools also allow one to quantitatively assess the role played by memory effects in the performance of thermodynamic protocols. We obtained exhaustive solutions on a laptop machine for systems with dimension $d\leq 7$, but with heuristic methods one could access much higher $d$.</description>

    <title>One-dimensional SPT phases protected by frieze symmetries</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12880</link>
    <author>Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Nicolas Dewolf, Jutho Haegeman, Frank Verstraete</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 28 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We undertake a systematic study of symmetry-protected topological gapped phases of quantum spin chains in the presence of the quasi-one-dimensional frieze space groups. Here, the spatial symmetries of the one-dimensional lattice are considered together with an additional 'vertical reflection', which we take to be an on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We identify seventeen distinct non-trivial phases and define canonical forms. If time-reversal is combined with a shift over one site, then no new topological phases arise. We furthermore construct explicit renormalization-group fixed point wavefunctions for symmetry-protected topological phases with global on-site symmetries, and demonstrate how group cohomology can be computed using the Smith normal form</description>

    <title>Quantum circuit compilation and hybrid computation using Pauli-based computation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01789</link>
    <author>F.C.R. Peres, Ernesto F. Galvão</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 04 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Pauli-based computation (PBC) is driven by a sequence of adaptively chosen, non-destructive measurements of Pauli observables. Any quantum circuit written in terms of the Clifford+$T$ gate set and having $t$ $T$ gates can be compiled into a PBC on $t$ qubits. Here we propose practical ways of implementing PBC as adaptive quantum circuits, and provide code to do the required classical side-processing. Our first scheme reduces the number of quantum gates to $O(t^2)$ (from a previous $O(t^3 / \log t)$ scaling) at the cost of one extra auxiliary qubit, with a possible reduction of the depth to $O(t \log t$), at the cost of $t$ additional auxiliary qubits (second scheme). We compile examples of random and hidden-shift quantum circuits into adaptive PBC circuits. We also simulate hybrid quantum computation, where a classical computer effectively extends the working memory of a small quantum computer by $k$ virtual qubits, at a cost exponential in $k$. Our results demonstrate the practical advantage of PBC techniques for circuit compilation and hybrid computation.</description>

    <title>Physics solutions for machine learning privacy leaks</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12319</link>

    <description>Machine learning systems are becoming more and more ubiquitous in increasingly complex areas, including cutting-edge scientific research. The opposite is also true: the interest in better understanding the inner workings of machine learning systems motivates their analysis under the lens of different scientific disciplines. Physics is particularly successful in this, due to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of phenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present, examples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve machine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application in the problem of developing algorithms that preserve the privacy of the manipulated data, which is especially important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. We develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to specific types of privacy leaks, and rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. These are inspired by the efficient representation of quantum many-body systems, and have shown to compete and even surpass traditional machine learning architectures in certain cases. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

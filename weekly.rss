    <title>Logical shadow tomography: Efficient estimation of error-mitigated observables</title>

    <description>We introduce a technique to estimate error-mitigated expectation values on noisy quantum computers. Our technique performs shadow tomography on a logical state to produce a memory-efficient classical reconstruction of the noisy density matrix. Using efficient classical post-processing, one can mitigate errors by projecting a general nonlinear function of the noisy density matrix into the codespace. The subspace expansion and virtual distillation can be viewed as special cases of the new framekwork. We show our method is favorable in the quantum and classical resources overhead. Relative to subspace expansion which requires $O\left(2^{N} \right)$ samples to estimate a logical Pauli observable with $[[N, k]]$ error correction code, our technique requires only $O\left(4^{k} \right)$ samples. Relative to virtual distillation, our technique can compute powers of the density matrix without additional copies of quantum states or quantum memory. We present numerical evidence using logical states encoded with up to sixty physical qubits and show fast convergence to error-free expectation values with only $10^5$ samples under 1% depolarizing noise.</description>

    <description>Mitigating errors in quantum information processing devices is especially important in the absence of fault tolerance. An effective method in suppressing state-preparation errors is using multiple copies to distill the ideal component from a noisy quantum state. Here, we use classical shadows and randomized measurements to circumvent the need for coherent access to multiple copies at an exponential cost. We study the scaling of resources using numerical simulations and find that the overhead is still favorable compared to full state tomography. We optimize measurement resources under realistic experimental constraints and apply our method to an experiment preparing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with trapped ions. In addition to improving stabilizer measurements, the analysis of the improved results reveals the nature of errors affecting the experiment. Hence, our results provide a directly applicable method for mitigating errors in near-term quantum computers.</description>

    <description>Parameterized complexity theory was developed in the 1990s to enrich the complexity-theoretic analysis of problems that depend on a range of parameters. In this paper we establish a quantum equivalent of classical parameterized complexity theory, motivated by the need for new tools for the classifications of the complexity of real-world problems. We introduce the quantum analogues of a range of parameterized complexity classes and examine the relationship between these classes, their classical counterparts, and well-studied problems. This framework exposes a rich classification of the complexity of parameterized versions of QMA-hard problems, demonstrating, for example, a clear separation between the Quantum Circuit Satisfiability problem and the Local Hamiltonian problem.</description>

    <description>Quantum error correction offers a promising path for performing quantum computations with low errors. Although a fully fault-tolerant execution of a quantum algorithm remains unrealized, recent experimental developments, along with improvements in control electronics, are enabling increasingly advanced demonstrations of the necessary operations for applying quantum error correction. Here, we perform quantum error correction on superconducting qubits connected in a heavy-hexagon lattice. The full processor can encode a logical qubit with distance three and perform several rounds of fault-tolerant syndrome measurements that allow the correction of any single fault in the circuitry. Furthermore, by using dynamic circuits and classical computation as part of our syndrome extraction protocols, we can exploit real-time feedback to reduce the impact of energy relaxation error in the syndrome and flag qubits. We show that the logical error varies depending on the use of a perfect matching decoder compared to a maximum likelihood decoder. We observe a logical error per syndrome measurement round as low as $\sim0.04$ for the matching decoder and as low as $\sim0.03$ for the maximum likelihood decoder. Our results suggest that more significant improvements to decoders are likely on the horizon as quantum hardware has reached a new stage of development towards fully fault-tolerant operations.</description>

    <title>Quantum algorithms from fluctuation theorems: Thermal-state preparation</title>

    <description>Fluctuation theorems provide a correspondence between properties of quantum systems in thermal equilibrium and a work distribution arising in a non-equilibrium process that connects two quantum systems with Hamiltonians $H_0$ and $H_1=H_0+V$. Building upon these theorems, we present a quantum algorithm to prepare a purification of the thermal state of $H_1$ at inverse temperature $\beta \ge 0$ starting from a purification of the thermal state of $H_0$. The complexity of the quantum algorithm, given by the number of uses of certain unitaries, is $\tilde {\cal O}(e^{\beta (\Delta \! A- w_l)/2})$, where $\Delta \! A$ is the free-energy difference between $H_1$ and $H_0,$ and $w_l$ is a work cutoff that depends on the properties of the work distribution and the approximation error $\epsilon>0$. If the non-equilibrium process is trivial, this complexity is exponential in $\beta \|V\|$, where $\|V\|$ is the spectral norm of $V$. This represents a significant improvement of prior quantum algorithms that have complexity exponential in $\beta \|H_1\|$ in the regime where $\|V\|\ll \|H_1\|$. The dependence of the complexity in $\epsilon$ varies according to the structure of the quantum systems. It can be exponential in $1/\epsilon$ in general, but we show it to be sublinear in $1/\epsilon$ if $H_0$ and $H_1$ commute, or polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if $H_0$ and $H_1$ are local spin systems. The possibility of applying a unitary that drives the system out of equilibrium allows one to increase the value of $w_l$ and improve the complexity even further. To this end, we analyze the complexity for preparing the thermal state of the transverse field Ising model using different non-equilibrium unitary processes and see significant complexity improvements.</description>

    <title>Detecting entanglement in quantum many-body systems via permutation moments</title>

    <description>Multipartite entanglement plays an essential role in both quantum information science and many-body physics. Due to the exponentially large dimension and complex geometric structure of the state space, the detection of entanglement in many-body systems is extremely challenging in reality. Conventional means, like entanglement witness and entropy criterion, either highly depend on the prior knowledge of the studied systems or the detection capability is relatively weak. In this work, we propose a framework for designing multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an effective implementation with either the generalized control-SWAP quantum circuits or the random unitary techniques. These criteria show strong detection capability in the multi-qubit Ising model with a long-range $XY$ Hamiltonian. The quantities associated with these criteria have clear physical meaning and can be used as entanglement quantifiers, with which we show the entanglement scaling transition in a quantum dynamical phase transition. Furthermore, our framework can also be generalized to detect the much more complicated entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.</description>

    <title>Towards experimental classical verification of quantum computation</title>

    <description>With today's quantum processors venturing into regimes beyond the capabilities of classical devices [1-3], we face the challenge to verify that these devices perform as intended, even when we cannot check their results on classical computers [4,5]. In a recent breakthrough in computer science [6-8], a protocol was developed that allows the verification of the output of a computation performed by an untrusted quantum device based only on classical resources. Here, we follow these ideas, and demonstrate in a first, proof-of-principle experiment a verification protocol using only classical means on a small trapped-ion quantum processor. We contrast this to verification protocols, which require trust and detailed hardware knowledge, as in gate-level benchmarking [9], or additional quantum resources in case we do not have access to or trust in the device to be tested [5]. While our experimental demonstration uses a simplified version [10] of Mahadev's protocol [6] we demonstrate the necessary steps for verifying fully untrusted devices. A scaled-up version of our protocol will allow for classical verification, requiring no hardware access or detailed knowledge of the tested device. Its security relies on post-quantum secure trapdoor functions within an interactive proof [11]. The conceptually straightforward, but technologically challenging scaled-up version of the interactive proofs, considered here, can be used for a variety of additional tasks such as verifying quantum advantage [8], generating [12] and certifying quantum randomness [7], or composable remote state preparation [13].</description>

    <title>Locality optimization for parent Hamiltonians of Tensor Networks</title>

    <description>Tensor Network states form a powerful framework for both the analytical and numerical study of strongly correlated phases. Vital to their analytical utility is that they appear as the exact ground states of associated parent Hamiltonians, where canonical proof techniques guarantee a controlled ground space structure. Yet, while those Hamiltonians are local by construction, the known techniques often yield complex Hamiltonians which act on a rather large number of spins. In this paper, we present an algorithm to systematically simplify parent Hamiltonians, breaking them down into any given basis of elementary interaction terms. The underlying optimization problem is a semidefinite program, and thus the optimal solution can be found efficiently. Our method exploits a degree of freedom in the construction of parent Hamiltonians -- the excitation spectrum of the local terms -- over which it optimizes such as to obtain the best possible approximation. We benchmark our method on the AKLT model and the Toric Code model, where we show that the canonical parent Hamiltonians (acting on 3 or 4 and 12 sites, respectively) can be broken down to the known optimal 2-body and 4-body terms. We then apply our method to the paradigmatic Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) model on the kagome lattice. Here, the simplest previously known parent Hamiltonian acts on all the 12 spins on one kagome star. With our optimization algorithm, we obtain a vastly simpler Hamiltonian: We find that the RVB model is the exact ground state of a parent Hamiltonian whose terms are all products of at most four Heisenberg interactions, and whose range can be further constrained, providing a major improvement over the previously known 12-body Hamiltonian.</description>

    <title>Intrinsic randomness under general quantum measurements</title>

    <description>Quantum measurements can produce randomness arising from the uncertainty principle. When measuring a state with von Neumann measurements, the intrinsic randomness can be quantified by the quantum coherence of the state on the measurement basis. Unlike projection measurements, there are additional and possibly hidden degrees of freedom in apparatus for generic measurements. We propose an adversary scenario for general measurements with arbitrary input states, based on which, we characterize the intrinsic randomness. Interestingly, we discover that under certain measurements, such as the symmetric and information-complete measurement, all states have nonzero randomness, inspiring a new design of source-independent random number generators without state characterization. Furthermore, our results show that intrinsic randomness can quantify coherence under general measurements, which generalizes the result in the standard resource theory of state coherence.</description>

    <title>Reducing the cost of energy estimation in the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm with robust amplitude estimation</title>

    <description>Quantum chemistry and materials is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. Yet much work is still to be done in matching industry-relevant problems in these areas with quantum algorithms that can solve them. Most previous efforts have carried out resource estimations for quantum algorithms run on large-scale fault-tolerant architectures, which include the quantum phase estimation algorithm. In contrast, few have assessed the performance of near-term quantum algorithms, which include the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Recently, a large-scale benchmark study [Gonthier et al. 2020] found evidence that the performance of the variational quantum eigensolver for a set of industry-relevant molecules may be too inefficient to be of practical use. This motivates the need for developing and assessing methods that improve the efficiency of VQE. In this work, we predict the runtime of the energy estimation subroutine of VQE when using robust amplitude estimation (RAE) to estimate Pauli expectation values. Under conservative assumptions, our resource estimation predicts that RAE can reduce the runtime over the standard estimation method in VQE by one to two orders of magnitude. Despite this improvement, we find that the runtimes are still too large to be practical. These findings motivate two complementary efforts towards quantum advantage: 1) the investigation of more efficient near-term methods for ground state energy estimation and 2) the development of problem instances that are of industrial value and classically challenging, but better suited to quantum computation.</description>

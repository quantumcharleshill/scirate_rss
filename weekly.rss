    <description>Understanding what can be learned from experiments is central to scientific progress. In this work, we use a learning-theoretic perspective to study the task of learning physical operations in a quantum machine when all operations (state preparation, dynamics, and measurement) are a priori unknown. We prove that, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state space by composing the operations, then every operation can be learned. When one cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately known and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient algorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter characterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel on Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer experiments than previously known protocols. Under more general conditions, the true description of the noise can be unlearnable; for example, we prove that no benchmarking protocol can learn gate-dependent Pauli noise on Clifford+T gates even under perfect state preparation and measurement. Despite not being able to learn the noise, we show that a noisy quantum computer that performs entangled measurements on multiple copies of an unknown state can yield a large advantage in learning properties of the state compared to a noiseless device that measures individual copies and then processes the measurement data using a classical computer. Concretely, we prove that noisy quantum computers with two-qubit gate error rate $\epsilon$ can achieve a learning task using $N$ copies of the state, while $N^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ copies are required classically.</description>

    <title>How to simulate key properties of lithium-ion batteries with a fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>

    <description>There is a pressing need to develop new rechargeable battery technologies that can offer higher energy storage, faster charging, and lower costs. Despite the success of existing methods for the simulation of battery materials, they can sometimes fall short of delivering accurate and reliable results. Quantum computing has been discussed as an avenue to overcome these issues, but only limited work has been done to outline how they may impact battery simulations. In this work, we provide a detailed answer to the following question: how can a quantum computer be used to simulate key properties of a lithium-ion battery? Based on recently-introduced first-quantization techniques, we lay out an end-to-end quantum algorithm for calculating equilibrium cell voltages, ionic mobility, and thermal stability. These can be obtained from ground-state energies of materials, which is the core calculation executed by the quantum computer using qubitization-based quantum phase estimation. The algorithm includes explicit methods for preparing approximate ground states of periodic materials in first quantization. We bring these insights together to perform the first estimation of the resources required to implement a quantum algorithm for simulating a realistic cathode material, dilithium iron silicate.</description>

    <title>Stability Experiments: The Overlooked Dual of Memory Experiments</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13834</link>

    <description>Topological quantum computations are built on a foundation of two basic tasks: preserving logical observables through time and moving logical observables through space. Memory experiments, which check how well logical observables are preserved through time, are a well established benchmark. Strangely, there is no corresponding well established benchmark for moving logical observables through space. This paper tries to fill that gap with "stability experiments", which check how well a quantum error correction system can determine the product of a large region of stabilizers. Stability experiments achieve this by testing on a region that is locally a normal code but globally has a known product of stabilizers.</description>

    <description>We establish a formal bridge between qubit-based and photonic quantum computing. We do this by defining a functor from the ZX calculus to linear optical circuits. In the process we provide a compositional theory of quantum linear optics which allows to reason about events involving multiple photons such as those required to perform linear-optical and fusion-based quantum computing.</description>

    <title>Quantum Dictionaries without QRAM</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13835</link>
    <author>Craig Gidney</author>
    <pubDate>May 02 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This paper presents an efficient gate-level implementation of a quantum dictionary: a data structure that can store a superposition of mappings from keys to values. The dictionary is stored as a fixed-length list of sorted address-value pairs, where the length of the list is the maximum number of entries that can be put in the dictionary. An addressed value can be extracted from (or injected into) the dictionary using $C \cdot (V + 2.5A) + O(V + A + C)$ expected Toffoli gates and $O(V + A)$ auxiliary qubits (where $C$ is the maximum capacity, $A$ is the address width, and $V$ is the value width).</description>

    <description>The rapid development in hardware for quantum computing and simulation has led to much interest in problems where these devices can exceed the capabilities of existing classical computers and known methods. Approaching this for problems that go beyond testing the performance of a quantum device is an important step, and quantum simulation of many-body quench dynamics is one of the most promising candidates for early practical quantum advantage. We analyse the requirements for quantitatively reliable quantum simulation beyond the capabilities of existing classical methods for analogue quantum simulators with neutral atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions. Considering the primary sources of error in analogue devices and how they propagate after a quench in studies of the Hubbard or long-range transverse field Ising model, we identify the level of error expected in quantities we extract from experiments. We conclude for models that are directly implementable that regimes of practical quantum advantage are attained in current experiments with analogue simulators. We also identify the hardware requirements to reach the same level of accuracy with future fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation. Verification techniques are already available to test the assumptions we make here, and demonstrating these in experiments will be an important next step.</description>

    <title>Divisible Codes for Quantum Computation</title>

    <description>Divisible codes are defined by the property that codeword weights share a common divisor greater than one. They are used to design signals for communications and sensing, and this paper explores how they can be used to protect quantum information as it is transformed by logical gates. Given a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$, we derive conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for a transversal diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ to preserve $\mathcal{C}$ and induce $U_L$. The group of $Z$-stabilizers in a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ is determined by the dual of a classical $[n, k_1]$ binary code $\mathcal{C}_1$, and the group of $X$-stabilizers is determined by a classical $[n, k_2]$ binary code $\mathcal{C}_2$ that is contained in $\mathcal{C}_1$. The requirement that a diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ fixes a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ leads to constraints on the congruence of weights in cosets of $\mathcal{C}_2$. These constraints are a perfect fit to divisible codes, and represent an opportunity to take advantage of the extensive literature on classical codes with two or three weights. We construct new families of CSS codes using cosets of the first order Reed Muller code defined by quadratic forms. We provide a simple alternative to the standard method of deriving the coset weight distributions (based on Dickson normal form) that may be of independent interest. Finally, we develop an approach to circumventing the Eastin-Knill Theorem which states that no QECC can implement a universal set of logical gates through transversal gates alone. The essential idea is to design stabilizer codes in layers, with $N_1$ inner qubits and $N_2$ outer qubits, and to assemble a universal set of fault tolerant gates on the inner qubits.</description>

    <title>Complexity of quantum circuits via sensitivity, magic, and coherence</title>

    <description>Quantum circuit complexity-a measure of the minimum number of gates needed to implement a given unitary transformation-is a fundamental concept in quantum computation, with widespread applications ranging from determining the running time of quantum algorithms to understanding the physics of black holes. In this work, we study the complexity of quantum circuits using the notions of sensitivity, average sensitivity (also called influence), magic, and coherence. We characterize the set of unitaries with vanishing sensitivity and show that it coincides with the family of matchgates. Since matchgates are tractable quantum circuits, we have proved that sensitivity is necessary for a quantum speedup. As magic is another measure to quantify quantum advantage, it is interesting to understand the relation between magic and sensitivity. We do this by introducing a quantum version of the Fourier entropy-influence relation. Our results are pivotal for understanding the role of sensitivity, magic, and coherence in quantum computation.</description>

    <title>Mutually Unbiased Measurements, Hadamard Matrices, and Superdense Coding</title>

    <description>Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are highly symmetric bases on complex Hilbert spaces, and the corresponding rank-1 projective measurements are ubiquitous in quantum information theory. In this work, we study a recently introduced generalization of MUBs called mutually unbiased measurements (MUMs). These measurements inherit the essential property of complementarity from MUBs, but the Hilbert space dimension is no longer required to match the number of outcomes. This operational complementarity property renders MUMs highly useful for device-independent quantum information processing. It has been shown that MUMs are strictly more general than MUBs. In this work we provide a complete proof of the characterization of MUMs that are direct sums of MUBs. We then proceed to construct new examples of MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. A crucial technical tool for these construction is a correspondence with quaternionic Hadamard matrices, which allows us to map known examples of such matrices to MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs. Furthermore, we show that -- in stark contrast with MUBs -- the number of MUMs for a fixed outcome number is unbounded. Next, we focus on the use of MUMs in quantum communication. We demonstrate how any pair of MUMs with d outcomes defines a d-dimensional superdense coding protocol. Using MUMs that are not direct sums of MUBs, we disprove a recent conjecture due to Nayak and Yuen on the rigidity of superdense coding for infinitely many dimensions.</description>

    <title>On converses to the polynomial method</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12303</link>

    <description>A surprising 'converse to the polynomial method' of Aaronson et al. (CCC'16) shows that any bounded quadratic polynomial can be computed exactly in expectation by a 1-query algorithm up to a universal multiplicative factor related to the famous Grothendieck constant. A natural question posed there asks if bounded quartic polynomials can be approximated by $2$-query quantum algorithms. Arunachalam, Palazuelos and the first author showed that there is no direct analogue of the result of Aaronson et al. in this case. We improve on this result in the following ways: First, we point out and fix a small error in the construction that has to do with a translation from cubic to quartic polynomials. Second, we give a completely explicit example based on techniques from additive combinatorics. Third, we show that the result still holds when we allow for a small additive error. For this, we apply an SDP characterization of Gribling and Laurent (QIP'19) for the completely-bounded approximate degree.</description>

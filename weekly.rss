    <title>Fully undistillable quantum states are separable</title>

    <description>Assume that Alice, Bob, and Eve share a tripartite pure state $|\psi_{ABE}\rangle$. We prove that if Alice cannot distill entanglement with either Bob or Eve using $|\psi_{ABE}\rangle$ and local operations with any one of the following configurations for classical communication: $(A\to B, A\leftrightarrow E), (A\leftrightarrow B, A\to E),$ and $(A\leftrightarrow B, A\leftrightarrow E)$, then the same is also true for the other two configurations. Moreover, this happens precisely when the state is such that both its reductions $\rho_{AB}$ and $\rho_{AE}$ are separable, which is further equivalent to the reductions being PPT. This, in particular, implies that any NPT bipartite state is such that either the state itself or its complement is 2-way distillable. In proving these results, we first obtain an explicit lower bound on the 2-way distillable entanglement of low rank bipartite states. Furthermore, we show that even though not all low rank states are 1-way distillable, a randomly sampled low rank state will almost surely be 1-way distillable.</description>

    <title>The QAOA gets stuck starting from a good classical string</title>

    <description>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to maximize a cost function over bit strings. While the initial state is traditionally a superposition over all strings, it is natural to try expediting the QAOA: first use a classical algorithm to produce some good string, and then run the ordinary QAOA starting in the computational basis state associated with that string. Here we report numerical experiments that this method of initializing the QAOA fails dramatically, exhibiting little to no improvement of the cost function. We investigate criteria for the rare instances in which there is any improvement at all, and we provide a statistical argument for the more typical case of no improvement. The statistical argument holds for any string that locally mimics the thermal ensemble at the appropriate temperature. Our numerical experiments indicate this property holds for typical good strings. We emphasize that our negative results only apply to our simple incarnation of the warm-start QAOA and may not apply to other approaches in the literature. We hope that our theoretical analysis will inform future algorithm design.</description>

    <title>Linear programming with unitary-equivariant constraints</title>

    <description>Unitary equivariance is a natural symmetry that occurs in many contexts in physics and mathematics. Optimization problems with such symmetry can often be formulated as semidefinite programs for a $d^{p+q}$-dimensional matrix variable that commutes with $U^{\otimes p} \otimes \bar{U}^{\otimes q}$, for all $U \in \mathrm{U}(d)$. Solving such problems naively can be prohibitively expensive even if $p+q$ is small but the local dimension $d$ is large. We show that, under additional symmetry assumptions, this problem reduces to a linear program that can be solved in time that does not scale in $d$, and we provide a general framework to execute this reduction under different types of symmetries. The key ingredient of our method is a compact parametrization of the solution space by linear combinations of walled Brauer algebra diagrams. This parametrization requires the idempotents of a Gelfand--Tsetlin basis, which we obtain by adapting a general method arXiv:1606.08900 inspired by the Okounkov--Vershik approach. To illustrate potential applications, we use several toy examples from quantum information: deciding the principal eigenvalue of a quantum state, quantum majority vote, and asymmetric cloning. We also outline a possible route for extending our method to general unitary-equivariant semidefinite programs.</description>

    <title>Finite-rate sparse quantum codes aplenty</title>

    <description>We introduce a methodology for generating random multi-qubit stabilizer codes based on solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on random bipartite graphs. This framework allows us to enforce stabilizer commutation, X/Z balancing, finite rate, sparsity, and maximum-degree constraints simultaneously in a CSP that we can then solve numerically. Using a state-of-the-art CSP solver, we obtain convincing evidence for the existence of a satisfiability threshold. Furthermore, the extent of the satisfiable phase increases with the number of qubits. In that phase, finding sparse codes becomes an easy problem. Moreover, we observe that the sparse codes found in the satisfiable phase practically achieve the channel capacity for erasure noise. Our results show that intermediate-size finite-rate sparse quantum codes are easy to find, while also demonstrating a flexible methodology for generating good codes with custom properties. We therefore establish a complete and customizable pipeline for random quantum code discovery that can be geared towards near to mid-term quantum processor layouts.</description>

    <title>Testing and Learning Quantum Juntas Nearly Optimally</title>

    <description>We consider the problem of testing and learning quantum $k$-juntas: $n$-qubit unitary matrices which act non-trivially on just $k$ of the $n$ qubits and as the identity on the rest. As our main algorithmic results, we give (a) a $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})$-query quantum algorithm that can distinguish quantum $k$-juntas from unitary matrices that are "far" from every quantum $k$-junta; and (b) a $O(4^k)$-query algorithm to learn quantum $k$-juntas. We complement our upper bounds for testing quantum $k$-juntas and learning quantum $k$-juntas with near-matching lower bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ and $\Omega(\frac{4^k}{k})$, respectively. Our techniques are Fourier-analytic and make use of a notion of influence of qubits on unitaries.</description>

    <description>Practical quantum computing will require error rates that are well below what is achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction offers a path to algorithmically-relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, where increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low in order for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here, we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across multiple code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, both in terms of logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ($2.914\%\pm 0.016\%$ compared to $3.028\%\pm 0.023\%$). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a $1.7\times10^{-6}$ logical error per round floor set by a single high-energy event ($1.6\times10^{-7}$ when excluding this event). We are able to accurately model our experiment, and from this model we can extract error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark the first experimental demonstration where quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.</description>

    <title>A density-matrix renormalisation group algorithm for simulating quantum circuits with a finite fidelity</title>

    <description>We develop a density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for the simulation of quantum circuits. This algorithm can be seen as the extension of time-dependent DMRG from the usual situation of hermitian Hamiltonian matrices to quantum circuits defined by unitary matrices. For small circuit depths, the technique is exact and equivalent to other matrix product state (MPS) based techniques. For larger depths, it becomes approximate in exchange for an exponential speed up in computational time. Like an actual quantum computer, the quality of the DMRG results is characterized by a finite fidelity. However, unlike a quantum computer, the fidelity depends strongly on the quantum circuit considered. For the most difficult possible circuit for this technique, the so-called "quantum supremacy" benchmark of Google Inc. , we find that the DMRG algorithm can generate bit strings of the same quality as the seminal Google experiment on a single computing core. For a more structured circuit used for combinatorial optimization (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm or QAOA), we find a drastic improvement of the DMRG results with error rates dropping by a factor of 100 compared with random quantum circuits. Our results suggest that the current bottleneck of quantum computers is their fidelities rather than the number of qubits.</description>

    <title>The concatenation of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code with the XZZX surface code</title>

    <description>Bosonic codes provide an alternative option for the quantum error correction. An important category of bosonic codes called the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code aroused much interest recently. Theoretically, the error correction ability of GKP code is limited since it can only correct small shift errors in position and momentum quadratures. A natural approach to promote the GKP error correction for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation is concatenating encoded GKP states with a stabilizer code. The performance of the XZZX surface-GKP code, i.e., the single-mode GKP code concatenated with XZZX surface code is investigated in this paper under two different noise models. Firstly, in the code-capacity noise model, the asymmetric rectangular GKP code with parameter $\lambda$ is introduced. Using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder combined with the continuous-variable GKP information, the optimal threshold of the XZZX-surface GKP code reaches $\sigma\approx0.67$ when $\lambda=2.1$, compared with the threshold $\sigma\approx0.60$ of the standard surface-GKP code. Secondly, we analyze the shift errors of two-qubit gates in the actual implementation, and build the full circuit-level noise model. The maximum likelihood decoding strategy is applied to each two-qubit gate with circuit-level noise, and improves the threshold from 18.6 dB in the previous work to 16.5 dB. We also estimate the overhead of the XZZX-surface GKP code which uses about 483 GKP states with squeezing more than 18.5 dB to encode a logical qubits with error rate $7.6\times10^{-6}$, compared with the qubit-based surface code using 1681 qubits to achieve almost the same logical error rate.</description>

    <title>Equivalence between simulability of high-dimensional measurements and high-dimensional steering</title>

    <description>The effect of quantum steering arises from the judicious combination of an entangled state with a set of incompatible measurements. Recently, it was shown that this form of quantum correlations can be quantified in terms of a dimension, leading to the notion of genuine high-dimensional steering. While this naturally connects to the dimensionality of entanglement (Schmidt number), we show that this effect also directly connects to a notion of dimension for measurement incompatibility. More generally, we present a general connection between the concepts of steering and measurement incompatibility, when quantified in terms of dimension. From this connection, we propose a novel twist on the problem of simulating quantum correlations. Specifically, we show how the correlations of certain high-dimensional entangled states can be exactly recovered using only shared randomness and lower-dimensional entanglement. Finally, we derive criteria for testing the dimension of measurement incompatibility, and discuss the extension of these ideas to quantum channels.</description>

    <title>Information flow in parameterized quantum circuits</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05149</link>

    <description>In this work, we introduce a new way to quantify information flow in quantum systems, especially for parameterized quantum circuits. We use a graph representation of the circuits and propose a new distance metric using the mutual information between gate nodes. We then present an optimization procedure for variational algorithms using paths based on the distance measure. We explore the features of the algorithm by means of the variational quantum eigensolver, in which we compute the ground state energies of the Heisenberg model. In addition, we employ the method to solve a binary classification problem using variational quantum classification. From numerical simulations, we show that our method can be successfully used for optimizing the parameterized quantum circuits primarily used in near-term algorithms. We further note that information-flow based paths can be used to improve convergence of existing stochastic gradient based methods.</description>

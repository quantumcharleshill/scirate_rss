    <title>Adaptive constant-depth circuits for manipulating non-abelian anyons</title>

    <description>We consider Kitaev's quantum double model based on a finite group $G$ and describe quantum circuits for (a) preparation of the ground state, (b) creation of anyon pairs separated by an arbitrary distance, and (c) non-destructive topological charge measurement. We show that for any solvable group $G$ all above tasks can be realized by constant-depth adaptive circuits with geometrically local unitary gates and mid-circuit measurements. Each gate may be chosen adaptively depending on previous measurement outcomes. Constant-depth circuits are well suited for implementation on a noisy hardware since it may be possible to execute the entire circuit within the qubit coherence time. Thus our results could facilitate an experimental study of exotic phases of matter with a non-abelian particle statistics. We also show that adaptiveness is essential for our circuit construction. Namely, task (b) cannot be realized by non-adaptive constant-depth local circuits for any non-abelian group $G$. This is in a sharp contrast with abelian anyons which can be created and moved over an arbitrary distance by a depth-$1$ circuit composed of generalized Pauli gates.</description>

    <title>Preparing Arbitrary Continuous Functions in Quantum Registers With Logarithmic Complexity</title>

    <description>Quantum computers will be able solve important problems with significant polynomial and exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, for instance in option pricing in finance, and in real-space molecular chemistry simulations. However, key applications can only achieve their potential speedup if their inputs are prepared efficiently. We effectively solve the important problem of efficiently preparing quantum states following arbitrary continuous (as well as more general) functions with complexity logarithmic in the desired resolution, and with rigorous error bounds. This is enabled by the development of a fundamental subroutine based off of the simulation of rank-1 projectors. Combined with diverse techniques from quantum information processing, this subroutine enables us to present a broad set of tools for solving practical tasks, such as state preparation, numerical integration of Lipschitz continuous functions, and superior sampling from probability density functions. As a result, our work has significant implications in a wide range of applications, for instance in financial forecasting, and in quantum simulation.</description>

    <title>Stability Experiments: The Overlooked Dual of Memory Experiments</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13834</link>
    <author>Craig Gidney</author>
    <pubDate>May 02 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Topological quantum computations are built on a foundation of two basic tasks: preserving logical observables through time and moving logical observables through space. Memory experiments, which check how well logical observables are preserved through time, are a well established benchmark. Strangely, there is no corresponding well established benchmark for moving logical observables through space. This paper tries to fill that gap with "stability experiments", which check how well a quantum error correction system can determine the product of a large region of stabilizers. Stability experiments achieve this by testing on a region that is locally a normal code but globally has a known product of stabilizers.</description>

    <title>Quantum Dictionaries without QRAM</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13835</link>

    <pubDate>May 02 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This paper presents an efficient gate-level implementation of a quantum dictionary: a data structure that can store a superposition of mappings from keys to values. The dictionary is stored as a fixed-length list of sorted address-value pairs, where the length of the list is the maximum number of entries that can be put in the dictionary. An addressed value can be extracted from (or injected into) the dictionary using $C \cdot (V + 2.5A) + O(V + A + C)$ expected Toffoli gates and $O(V + A)$ auxiliary qubits (where $C$ is the maximum capacity, $A$ is the address width, and $V$ is the value width).</description>

    <title>What is the temperature of a quantum state?</title>

    <description>Temperature is usually defined for physical systems at thermal equilibrium. Nevertheless one may wonder if it would be possible to attribute a meaningful notion of temperature to an arbitrary quantum state, beyond simply the thermal (Gibbs) state. In this work, we propose such a notion of temperature considering an operational task, inspired by the Zeroth Law of thermodynamics. Specifically, we define two effective temperatures for quantifying the ability of a quantum system to cool down or heat up a thermal environment. In this way we can associate an operationally meaningful notion of temperature to any quantum density matrix. We provide general expressions for these effective temperatures, for both single- and many-copy systems, establishing connections to concepts previously discussed in the literature. Finally, we consider a more sophisticated scenario where the heat exchange between the system and the thermal environment is assisted by a quantum reference frame. This leads to an effect of "coherent quantum catalysis", where the use of a coherent catalyst allows for exploiting quantum energetic coherences in the system, now leading to much colder or hotter effective temperatures.</description>

    <description>Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore, naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator. We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form $C_1HC_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are Hadamard-free circuits and $H$ is a layer of Hadamard gates. We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.</description>

    <title>Efficient quantum algorithm for nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations and energy estimation</title>

    <description>Nonlinear differential equations exhibit rich phenomena in many fields but are notoriously challenging to solve. Recently, Liu et al. [1] demonstrated the first efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative quadratic differential equations under the condition $R < 1$, where $R$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the $\ell_2$ norm. Here we develop an efficient quantum algorithm based on [1] for reaction-diffusion equations, a class of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve this, we improve upon the Carleman linearization approach introduced in [1] to obtain a faster convergence rate under the condition $R_D < 1$, where $R_D$ measures the ratio of nonlinearity to dissipation using the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Since $R_D$ is independent of the number of spatial grid points $n$ while $R$ increases with $n$, the criterion $R_D<1$ is significantly milder than $R<1$ for high-dimensional systems and can stay convergent under grid refinement for approximating PDEs. As applications of our quantum algorithm we consider the Fisher-KPP and Allen-Cahn equations, which have interpretations in classical physics. In particular, we show how to estimate the mean square kinetic energy in the solution by postprocessing the quantum state that encodes it to extract derivative information.</description>

    <title>A fast quantum algorithm for computing matrix permanent</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.01328</link>

    <description>Computing a matrix permanent is known to be a classically intractable problem. This paper presents the first polynomial time quantum algorithm for computing permanents of arbitrary $N$-dimensional square matrices with multiplicative error and additive error protocols. We transformed the well-known classical algorithm, Ryser's formula, into sums of quantum overlap integrals to develop the quantum algorithm. This requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^{3})$ evaluations of the real part of the quantum overlap integrals for real and complex matrices, respectively, with polynomial depth quantum circuits of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits. The existence of the polynomial time multiplicative error estimation of a matrix permanent would strongly imply that quantum computers can access the #P-hard problem. Our quantum algorithm attains the milestone of opening a new direction in quantum computing and computational complexity theory. It could resolve crucial computational complexity issues like locating the bounded error quantum polynomial time (BQP) relative to the polynomial hierarchy, which has been a big complexity question. Depending on the size of a matrix norm of interest, we can also obtain an exponentially small additive error estimation and better estimation against Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The additive error protocol is practically implementable in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Moreover, our quantum algorithm directly shows the computational complexity connection between the matrix permanent and the real-time partition function of the quantum Ising Hamiltonian.</description>

    <title>Complete flow-preserving rewrite rules for MBQC patterns with Pauli measurements</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02009</link>

    <description>In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), computation proceeds via measurements on some standard resource state. So-called flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, with Pauli flow being the most general of these. Existing work on rewriting MBQC patterns while preserving the existence of flow has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits. In this work, we show that introducing new $Z$-measured qubits, connected to any subset of the existing qubits, preserves the existence of Pauli flow. Furthermore, we give a unique canonical form for stabilizer ZX-diagrams inspired by recent work of Hu & Khesin [arXiv:2109.10210]. We prove that any MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagram with Pauli flow can be rewritten into this canonical form using only rules which preserve the existence of Pauli flow and that each of these rules can be reversed while also preserving the existence of Pauli flow. Hence we have complete graphical rewriting for MBQC-like stabilizer ZX-diagrams with Pauli flow.</description>

    <title>Phase-free ZX diagrams are CSS codes (...or how to graphically grok the surface code)</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.14038</link>
    <author>Aleks Kissinger</author>

    <description>In this paper, we demonstrate a direct correspondence between phase-free ZX diagrams, a graphical notation for representing and manipulating a certain class of linear maps on qubits, and Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a large family of quantum error correcting codes constructed from classical codes, including for example the Steane code, surface codes, and colour codes. The stabilisers of a CSS code have an especially nice structure arising from a pair of orthogonal $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspaces, or in the case of maximal CSS codes, a single subspace and its orthocomplement. On the other hand, phase-free ZX diagrams can always be efficiently reduced to a normal form given by the basis elements of an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace. Here, we will show that these two ways of describing a quantum state by an $\mathbb F_2$-linear subspace $S$ are in fact the same. Namely, the maximal CSS code generated by $S$ fixes the quantum state whose ZX normal form is also given by $S$. This insight gives us an immediate translation from stabilisers of a maximal CSS code into a ZX diagram describing its associated state. We show that we can extend this translation to stabilisers and logical operators of any (possibly non-maximal) CSS code by "bending wires". To demonstrate the utility of this translation, we give a simple picture of the surface code and a fully graphical derivation of the action of physical lattice surgery operations on the space of logical qubits, completing the ZX presentation of lattice surgery initiated by de Beudrap and Horsman.</description>

    <description>We consider the problem of reproducing one quantum measurement given the ability to perform another. In particular, given the availability of a -- possibly imperfect -- quantum measurement which can be performed multiple times, we study to what extent it can reproduce the measurement statistics and post-measurement state of a second target measurement, in the most general setting where both the available and target measurements are arbitrary generalised quantum measurements. We show that this general problem in fact reduces to the ability to reproduce the statistics of von Neumann measurements, and that in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many uses of the available measurement, a simple protocol based upon `classical cloning' is able to perfectly achieve this task. This shows that asymptotically all (non-trivial) quantum measurements are equivalent. We also study optimal protocols for a fixed number of uses of the available measurement, and show that better protocols than classical cloning can be found in general. Our protocols show that the average error in reproducing a target measurement drops off exponentially fast, and that one can, for example, rapidly improve imperfect measurements by performing them a small number of times. This includes, but is not limited to, improving both noisy and lossy quantum measurements. Finally, we show that in a setting where we perform multiple measurements in parallel, we can moreover achieve finite-rate measurement reproduction, by using block-coding techniques from classical information theory.</description>

    <description>Biased noise is common in physical qubits, and tailoring a quantum code to the bias by locally modifying stabilizers or changing boundary conditions has been shown to greatly increase error correction thresholds. In this work, we explore the challenges of using a specific tailored code, the XY surface code, for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce an efficient and fault-tolerant decoder, belief-matching, which we show has good performance for biased circuit-level noise. Using this decoder, we find that for moderately biased noise, the XY surface code has a higher threshold and lower overhead than the square CSS surface code, however it performs worse when below threshold than the rectangular CSS surface code. We identify a contributor to the reduced performance that we call fragile boundary errors. These are string-like errors that can occur along spatial or temporal boundaries in planar architectures or during logical state preparation and measurement. While we make partial progress towards mitigating these errors by deforming the boundaries of the XY surface code, our work suggests that fragility could remain a significant obstacle, even for other tailored codes. We expect belief-matching will have other uses, and find that it increases the threshold of the surface code to 0.940(3)% in the presence of circuit-level depolarising noise, compared to 0.817(5)% for a minimum-weight perfect matching decoder.</description>

    <description>Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are quantum stabilizer codes where each stabilizer acts on a constant number of qubits and each qubit is acted on by a constant number of stabilizers. We study qLDPC codes constructed from balanced products and lossless expanders. We found that assuming the existence of 2-sided lossless expander graphs with free group action, the resulting qLDPC codes have constant rate, linear distance, and linear time decoders.</description>

    <title>Quantum algorithms for estimating quantum entropies</title>

    <description>The von Neumann and quantum Rényi entropies characterize fundamental properties of quantum systems and lead to theoretical and practical applications in many fields. Quantum algorithms for estimating quantum entropies, using a quantum query model that prepares the purification of the input state, have been established in the literature. However, constructing such a model is almost as hard as state tomography. In this paper, we propose quantum algorithms to estimate the von Neumann and quantum $\alpha$-Rényi entropies of an $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$ using independent copies of the input state. We also show how to efficiently construct the quantum circuits for quantum entropy estimation using primitive single/two-qubit gates. We prove that the number of required copies scales polynomially in $1/\epsilon$ and $1/\Lambda$, where $\epsilon$ denotes the additive precision and $\Lambda$ denotes the lower bound on all non-zero eigenvalues. Notably, our method outperforms previous methods in the aspect of practicality since it does not require any quantum query oracles, which are usually necessary for previous methods. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to show the efficacy of our algorithms to single-qubit states and study the noise robustness. We also discuss the applications to some quantum states of practical interest as well as some meaningful tasks such as quantum Gibbs state preparation and entanglement estimation.</description>

    <title>Improved Quantum Query Upper Bounds Based on Classical Decision Trees</title>

    <description>Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$. Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree. Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.</description>

    <title>Semidefinite programming lower bounds on the squashed entanglement</title>

    <description>The squashed entanglement is a widely used entanglement measure that has many desirable properties. However, as it is based on an optimization over extensions of arbitrary dimension, one drawback of this measure is the lack of good algorithms to compute it. Here, we introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite programming lower bounds on the squashed entanglement.</description>

    <description>Classical information, also known as shadow information, carried by quantum states could be corrupted as they undergo undesirable noises modelled by quantum channels. Due to quantum channels' destructive nature, a fundamental problem in quantum information theory is how well we can retrieve information from noisy quantum states. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to quantitatively study this problem. First, we prove that classical information can be retrieved if and only if the querying observable is in the image of the whole observable space under the channel's adjoint. Second, we further define the dimension of the evolved observable space as the quantum channel's effective shadow dimension that quantifies the information recoverability of the channel. This quantity can be computed as the rank of a matrix derived from the channel's Kraus operators, and it induces the shadow destructivity as a measure with meaningful properties. Third, we resolve the minimum cost of retrieving a piece of shadow information from the required number of copies of a noisy state. We in particular show that the optimal cost and the corresponding protocol are efficiently computable by semidefinite programming. As applications, we derive the ultimate limits on shadow retrieving costs for generalized amplitude damping channels and mixed Pauli channels and employ the corresponding protocol to mitigate errors in tasks of ground state energy estimation.</description>

    <title>Differential Privacy Amplification in Quantum and Quantum-inspired Algorithms</title>

    <description>Differential privacy provides a theoretical framework for processing a dataset about $n$ users, in a way that the output reveals a minimal information about any single user. Such notion of privacy is usually ensured by noise-adding mechanisms and amplified by several processes, including subsampling, shuffling, iteration, mixing and diffusion. In this work, we provide privacy amplification bounds for quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms. In particular, we show for the first time, that algorithms running on quantum encoding of a classical dataset or the outcomes of quantum-inspired classical sampling, amplify differential privacy. Moreover, we prove that a quantum version of differential privacy is amplified by the composition of quantum channels, provided that they satisfy some mixing conditions.</description>

    <title>Quantum computation with cat qubits</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03222</link>

    <pubDate>Mar 08 2022</pubDate>
    <description>These are the lecture notes from the 2019 Les Houches Summer School on "Quantum Information Machines". After a brief introduction to quantum error correction and bosonic codes, we focus on the case of cat qubits stabilized by a nonlinear multi-photon driven dissipation process. We argue that such a system can be seen as a self-correcting qubit where bit-flip errors are robustly and exponentially suppressed. Next, we provide some experimental directions to engineer such a multi-photon driven dissipation process with superconducting circuits. Finally, we analyze various logical gates that can be implemented without re-introducing bit-flip errors. This set of bias-preserving gates pave the way towards a hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum processor.</description>

    <title>Quantum Volume in Practice: What Users Can Expect from NISQ Devices</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.03816</link>

    <description>Quantum volume (QV) has become the de-facto standard benchmark to quantify the capability of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. While QV values are often reported by NISQ providers for their systems, we perform our own series of QV calculations on more than 20 NISQ devices currently (2021/2022) offered by IBM Q, IonQ, Rigetti, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and Honeywell/Quantinuum. Our approach characterizes the performances that an advanced user of these NISQ devices can expect to achieve with a reasonable amount of optimization, but without white-box access to the device. In particular, we compile QV circuits to standard gate sets of the vendor using compiler optimization routines where available, and we perform experiments across different initial qubit mappings. We find that running QV tests requires very significant compilation cycles, QV values achieved in our tests typically lag behind officially reported results and also depend significantly on the classical compilation effort invested.</description>

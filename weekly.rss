    <description>Understanding what can be learned from experiments is central to scientific progress. In this work, we use a learning-theoretic perspective to study the task of learning physical operations in a quantum machine when all operations (state preparation, dynamics, and measurement) are a priori unknown. We prove that, without any prior knowledge, if one can explore the full quantum state space by composing the operations, then every operation can be learned. When one cannot explore the full state space but all operations are approximately known and noise in Clifford gates is gate-independent, we find an efficient algorithm for learning all operations up to a single unlearnable parameter characterizing the fidelity of the initial state. For learning a noise channel on Clifford gates to a fixed accuracy, our algorithm uses quadratically fewer experiments than previously known protocols. Under more general conditions, the true description of the noise can be unlearnable; for example, we prove that no benchmarking protocol can learn gate-dependent Pauli noise on Clifford+T gates even under perfect state preparation and measurement. Despite not being able to learn the noise, we show that a noisy quantum computer that performs entangled measurements on multiple copies of an unknown state can yield a large advantage in learning properties of the state compared to a noiseless device that measures individual copies and then processes the measurement data using a classical computer. Concretely, we prove that noisy quantum computers with two-qubit gate error rate $\epsilon$ can achieve a learning task using $N$ copies of the state, while $N^{\Omega(1/\epsilon)}$ copies are required classically.</description>

    <title>Chain rules for quantum channels</title>

    <description>Divergence chain rules for channels relate the divergence of a pair of channel inputs and to the divergence of the corresponding channel outputs. An important special case of such a rule is the data-processing inequality, which tells us that if the same channel is applied to both inputs then the divergence cannot increase. Based on direct matrix analysis methods, we derive several Rényi divergence chain rules for channels in the quantum setting. Our results simplify and in some cases generalise previous derivations in the literature.</description>

    <title>Efficient Certifiable Randomness from a Single Quantum Device</title>

    <description>Brakerski et. al [BCM+18] introduced the model of cryptographic testing of a single untrusted quantum device and gave a protocol for certifiable randomness generation. We use the leakage resilience properties of the Learning With Errors problem to address a key issue left open in previous work - the rate of generation of randomness. Our new protocol can certify $\Omega(n)$ fresh bits of randomness in constant rounds, where $n$ is a parameter of the protocol and the total communication is $O(n)$, thus achieving a nearly optimal rate. The proof that the output is statistically random is conceptually simple and technically elementary.</description>

    <description>There is a pressing need to develop new rechargeable battery technologies that can offer higher energy storage, faster charging, and lower costs. Despite the success of existing methods for the simulation of battery materials, they can sometimes fall short of delivering accurate and reliable results. Quantum computing has been discussed as an avenue to overcome these issues, but only limited work has been done to outline how they may impact battery simulations. In this work, we provide a detailed answer to the following question: how can a quantum computer be used to simulate key properties of a lithium-ion battery? Based on recently-introduced first-quantization techniques, we lay out an end-to-end quantum algorithm for calculating equilibrium cell voltages, ionic mobility, and thermal stability. These can be obtained from ground-state energies of materials, which is the core calculation executed by the quantum computer using qubitization-based quantum phase estimation. The algorithm includes explicit methods for preparing approximate ground states of periodic materials in first quantization. We bring these insights together to perform the first estimation of the resources required to implement a quantum algorithm for simulating a realistic cathode material, dilithium iron silicate.</description>

    <description>Inherent symmetry of a quantum system may protect its otherwise fragile states. Leveraging such protection requires testing its robustness against uncontrolled environmental interactions. Using 47 superconducting qubits, we implement the kicked Ising model which exhibits Majorana edge modes (MEMs) protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ parity symmetry. Remarkably, we find that any multi-qubit Pauli operator overlapping with the MEMs exhibits a uniform decay rate comparable to single-qubit relaxation rates, irrespective of its size or composition. This finding allows us to accurately reconstruct the exponentially localized spatial profiles of the MEMs. Spectroscopic measurements further indicate exponentially suppressed hybridization between the MEMs at larger system sizes, which manifests as a strong resilience against low-frequency noise. Our work elucidates the noise sensitivity of symmetry-protected edge modes in a solid-state environment.</description>

    <description>We establish a formal bridge between qubit-based and photonic quantum computing. We do this by defining a functor from the ZX calculus to linear optical circuits. In the process we provide a compositional theory of quantum linear optics which allows to reason about events involving multiple photons such as those required to perform linear-optical and fusion-based quantum computing.</description>

    <description>The rapid development in hardware for quantum computing and simulation has led to much interest in problems where these devices can exceed the capabilities of existing classical computers and known methods. Approaching this for problems that go beyond testing the performance of a quantum device is an important step, and quantum simulation of many-body quench dynamics is one of the most promising candidates for early practical quantum advantage. We analyse the requirements for quantitatively reliable quantum simulation beyond the capabilities of existing classical methods for analogue quantum simulators with neutral atoms in optical lattices and trapped ions. Considering the primary sources of error in analogue devices and how they propagate after a quench in studies of the Hubbard or long-range transverse field Ising model, we identify the level of error expected in quantities we extract from experiments. We conclude for models that are directly implementable that regimes of practical quantum advantage are attained in current experiments with analogue simulators. We also identify the hardware requirements to reach the same level of accuracy with future fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation. Verification techniques are already available to test the assumptions we make here, and demonstrating these in experiments will be an important next step.</description>

    <title>Divisible Codes for Quantum Computation</title>

    <description>Divisible codes are defined by the property that codeword weights share a common divisor greater than one. They are used to design signals for communications and sensing, and this paper explores how they can be used to protect quantum information as it is transformed by logical gates. Given a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$, we derive conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for a transversal diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ to preserve $\mathcal{C}$ and induce $U_L$. The group of $Z$-stabilizers in a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ is determined by the dual of a classical $[n, k_1]$ binary code $\mathcal{C}_1$, and the group of $X$-stabilizers is determined by a classical $[n, k_2]$ binary code $\mathcal{C}_2$ that is contained in $\mathcal{C}_1$. The requirement that a diagonal physical operator $U_Z$ fixes a CSS code $\mathcal{C}$ leads to constraints on the congruence of weights in cosets of $\mathcal{C}_2$. These constraints are a perfect fit to divisible codes, and represent an opportunity to take advantage of the extensive literature on classical codes with two or three weights. We construct new families of CSS codes using cosets of the first order Reed Muller code defined by quadratic forms. We provide a simple alternative to the standard method of deriving the coset weight distributions (based on Dickson normal form) that may be of independent interest. Finally, we develop an approach to circumventing the Eastin-Knill Theorem which states that no QECC can implement a universal set of logical gates through transversal gates alone. The essential idea is to design stabilizer codes in layers, with $N_1$ inner qubits and $N_2$ outer qubits, and to assemble a universal set of fault tolerant gates on the inner qubits.</description>

    <title>Complexity of quantum circuits via sensitivity, magic, and coherence</title>

    <description>Quantum circuit complexity-a measure of the minimum number of gates needed to implement a given unitary transformation-is a fundamental concept in quantum computation, with widespread applications ranging from determining the running time of quantum algorithms to understanding the physics of black holes. In this work, we study the complexity of quantum circuits using the notions of sensitivity, average sensitivity (also called influence), magic, and coherence. We characterize the set of unitaries with vanishing sensitivity and show that it coincides with the family of matchgates. Since matchgates are tractable quantum circuits, we have proved that sensitivity is necessary for a quantum speedup. As magic is another measure to quantify quantum advantage, it is interesting to understand the relation between magic and sensitivity. We do this by introducing a quantum version of the Fourier entropy-influence relation. Our results are pivotal for understanding the role of sensitivity, magic, and coherence in quantum computation.</description>

    <title>Simulation and performance analysis of quantum error correction with a rotated surface code under a realistic noise model</title>

    <description>The demonstration of quantum error correction (QEC) is one of the most important milestones in the realization of fully-fledged quantum computers. Toward this, QEC experiments using the surface codes have recently been actively conducted. However, it has not yet been realized to protect logical quantum information beyond the physical coherence time. In this work, we performed a full simulation of QEC for the rotated surface codes with a code distance 5, which employs 49 qubits and is within reach of the current state-of-the-art quantum computers. In particular, we evaluate the logical error probability in a realistic noise model that incorporates not only stochastic Pauli errors but also coherent errors due to a systematic control error or unintended interactions. While a straightforward simulation of 49 qubits is not tractable within a reasonable computational time, we reduced the number of qubits required to 26 qubits by delaying the syndrome measurement in simulation. This and a fast quantum computer simulator, Qulacs, implemented on GPU allows us to simulate full QEC with an arbitrary local noise within reasonable simulation time. Based on the numerical results, we also construct and verify an effective model to incorporate the effect of the coherent error into a stochastic noise model. This allows us to understand what the effect coherent error has on the logical error probability on a large scale without full simulation based on the detailed full simulation of a small scale. The present simulation framework and effective model, which can handle arbitrary local noise, will play a vital role in clarifying the physical parameters that future experimental QEC should target.</description>

    <title>Benchmarking the Planar Honeycomb Code</title>

    <description>We improve the planar honeycomb code by describing boundaries that need no additional physical connectivity, and by optimizing the shape of the qubit patch. We then benchmark the code using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate logical error rates and derive metrics including thresholds, lambdas, and teraquop qubit counts. We determine that the planar honeycomb code can create a logical qubit with one-in-a-trillion logical error rates using 7000 physical qubits at a 0.1% gate-level error rate (or 900 physical qubits given native two-qubit parity measurements). Our results cement the honeycomb code as a promising candidate for two-dimensional qubit architectures with sparse connectivity.</description>

    <title>Quantum Tanner codes</title>

    <description>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes. In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</description>

    <title>The XP Stabiliser Formalism: a Generalisation of the Pauli Stabiliser Formalism with Arbitrary Phases</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.00103</link>
    <author>Mark A. Webster, Benjamin J. Brown, Stephen D. Bartlett</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 02 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We propose an extension to the Pauli stabiliser formalism that includes fractional $2\pi/N$ rotations around the $Z$ axis for some integer $N$. The resulting generalised stabiliser formalism - denoted the XP stabiliser formalism - allows for a wider range of states and codespaces to be represented. We describe the states which arise in the formalism, and demonstrate an equivalence between XP stabiliser states and 'weighted hypergraph states' - a generalisation of both hypergraph and weighted graph states. Given an arbitrary set of XP operators, we present algorithms for determining the codespace and logical operators for an XP code. Finally, we consider whether measurements of XP operators on XP codes can be classically simulated.</description>

    <title>Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time</title>

    <description>In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984], [arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of total time complexity of both the client and the server, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be verified, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082]. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in \{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side isometry), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$ time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].</description>

    <title>Performance of planar Floquet codes with Majorana-based qubits</title>

    <description>Quantum error correction is crucial for any quantum computing platform to achieve truly scalable quantum computation. The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude, and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.</description>

    <title>Influence in Completely Bounded Block-multilinear Forms and Classical Simulation of Quantum Algorithms</title>

    <description>The Aaronson-Ambainis conjecture (Theory of Computing '14) says that every low-degree bounded polynomial on the Boolean hypercube has an influential variable. This conjecture, if true, would imply that the acceptance probability of every $d$-query quantum algorithm can be well-approximated almost everywhere (i.e., on almost all inputs) by a $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-query classical algorithm. We prove a special case of the conjecture: in every completely bounded degree-$d$ block-multilinear form with constant variance, there always exists a variable with influence at least $1/\mathrm{poly}(d)$. In a certain sense, such polynomials characterize the acceptance probability of quantum query algorithms, as shown by Arunachalam, Briët and Palazuelos (SICOMP '19). As a corollary we obtain efficient classical almost-everywhere simulation for a particular class of quantum algorithms that includes for instance $k$-fold Forrelation. Our main technical result relies on connections to free probability theory.</description>

    <title>Optimizing thermalizations</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12616</link>

    <description>We present a rigorous approach, based on the concept of continuous thermomajorisation, to algorithmically characterise the full set of energy occupations of a quantum system accessible from a given initial state through weak interactions with a heat bath. The algorithm can be deployed to solve complex optimization problems in out-of-equilibrium setups and it returns explicit elementary control sequences realizing optimal transformations. We illustrate this by finding optimal protocols in the context of cooling, work extraction and catalysis. The same tools also allow one to quantitatively assess the role played by memory effects in the performance of thermodynamic protocols. We obtained exhaustive solutions on a laptop machine for systems with dimension $d\leq 7$, but with heuristic methods one could access much higher $d$.</description>

    <title>One-dimensional SPT phases protected by frieze symmetries</title>

    <description>We undertake a systematic study of symmetry-protected topological gapped phases of quantum spin chains in the presence of the quasi-one-dimensional frieze space groups. Here, the spatial symmetries of the one-dimensional lattice are considered together with an additional 'vertical reflection', which we take to be an on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We identify seventeen distinct non-trivial phases and define canonical forms. If time-reversal is combined with a shift over one site, then no new topological phases arise. We furthermore construct explicit renormalization-group fixed point wavefunctions for symmetry-protected topological phases with global on-site symmetries, and demonstrate how group cohomology can be computed using the Smith normal form</description>

    <title>Physics solutions for machine learning privacy leaks</title>

    <description>Machine learning systems are becoming more and more ubiquitous in increasingly complex areas, including cutting-edge scientific research. The opposite is also true: the interest in better understanding the inner workings of machine learning systems motivates their analysis under the lens of different scientific disciplines. Physics is particularly successful in this, due to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of phenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present, examples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve machine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application in the problem of developing algorithms that preserve the privacy of the manipulated data, which is especially important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. We develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to specific types of privacy leaks, and rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. These are inspired by the efficient representation of quantum many-body systems, and have shown to compete and even surpass traditional machine learning architectures in certain cases. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

    <title>Optimal quantum dataset for learning a unitary transformation</title>

    <description>Unitary transformations formulate the time evolution of quantum states. How to learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in quantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a quantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although presence of more training data results in better models, using too much data reduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the minimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary transformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data. First, we prove that the minimum size of dataset with pure states is $2^n$ for learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the capability of quantum data, we introduce a quantum dataset consisting of $n+1$ mixed states that are sufficient for exact training. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling, which leads to an exponential improvement on the size over the datasets with pure states. Furthermore, we show that the size of quantum dataset with mixed states can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset for learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle compiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to accurately simulate a 3-qubit one-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, our circuit only uses $48$ elementary quantum gates, which is significantly less than $4320$ gates in the circuit constructed by the Trotter-Suzuki product formula.</description>

    <description>Quantum pseudorandom states are efficiently constructable states which nevertheless masquerade as Haar-random states to poly-time observers. First defined by Ji, Liu and Song, such states have found a number of applications ranging from cryptography to the AdS/CFT correspondence. A fundamental question is exactly how much entanglement is required to create such states. Haar-random states, as well as $t$-designs for $t\geq 2$, exhibit near-maximal entanglement. Here we provide the first construction of pseudorandom states with only polylogarithmic entanglement entropy across an equipartition of the qubits, which is the minimum possible. Our construction can be based on any one-way function secure against quantum attack. We additionally show that the entanglement in our construction is fully "tunable", in the sense that one can have pseudorandom states with entanglement $\Theta(f(n))$ for any desired function $\omega(\log n) \leq f(n) \leq O(n)$. More fundamentally, our work calls into question to what extent entanglement is a "feelable" quantity of quantum systems. Inspired by recent work of Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define a new notion which we call "pseudoentanglement", which are ensembles of efficiently constructable quantum states which hide their entanglement entropy. We show such states exist in the strongest form possible while simultaneously being pseudorandom states. We also describe diverse applications of our result from entanglement distillation to property testing to quantum gravity.</description>

    <title>Deterministic constant-depth preparation of the AKLT state on a quantum processor using fusion measurements</title>

    <description>The ground state of the spin-1 Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Tasaki (AKLT) model is a paradigmatic example of both a matrix product state and a symmetry-protected topological phase, and additionally holds promise as a resource state for measurement-based quantum computation. Having a nonzero correlation length, the AKLT state cannot be exactly prepared by a constant-depth unitary circuit composed of local gates. In this work, we demonstrate that this no-go limit can be evaded by augmenting a constant-depth circuit with fusion measurements, such that the total preparation time is independent of system size and entirely deterministic. We elucidate our preparation scheme using the language of tensor networks, and furthermore show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the AKLT state directly affords this speed-up over previously known preparation methods. To demonstrate the practical advantage of measurement-assisted preparation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we carry out our protocol on an IBM Quantum processor. We measure both the string order and entanglement spectrum of prepared AKLT chains and, employing these as metrics, find improved results over the known (purely unitary) sequential preparation approach. We conclude with a demonstration of quantum teleportation using the AKLT state prepared by our measurement-assisted scheme. This work thus serves to provide an efficient strategy to prepare a specific resource in the form of the AKLT state and, more broadly, experimentally demonstrates the possibility for realizable improvement in state preparation afforded by measurement-based circuit depth reduction strategies on NISQ-era devices.</description>

    <title>Invertible bimodule categories and generalized Schur orthogonality</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01947</link>

    <description>The Schur orthogonality relations are a cornerstone in the representation theory of groups. We utilize a generalization to weak Hopf algebras to provide a new, readily verifiable condition on the skeletal data for deciding whether a given bimodule category is invertible and therefore defines a Morita equivalence. As a first application, we provide an algorithm for the construction of the full skeletal data of the invertible bimodule category associated to a given module category, which is obtained in a unitary gauge when the underlying categories are unitary. As a second application, we show that our condition for invertibility is equivalent to the notion of MPO-injectivity, thereby closing an open question concerning tensor network representations of string-net models exhibiting topological order. We discuss applications to generalized symmetries, including a generalized Wigner-Eckart theorem.</description>

    <title>Pseudorandom (Function-Like) Quantum State Generators: New Definitions and Applications</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01444</link>
    <author>Prabhanjan Ananth, Aditya Gulati, Luowen Qian, Henry Yuen</author>

    <description>Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) are efficiently constructible states that are computationally indistinguishable from being Haar-random, and have recently found cryptographic applications. We explore new definitions, new properties and applications of pseudorandom states, and present the following contributions: 1. New Definitions: We study variants of pseudorandom function-like state (PRFS) generators, introduced by Ananth, Qian, and Yuen (CRYPTO'22), where the pseudorandomness property holds even when the generator can be queried adaptively or in superposition. We show feasibility of these variants assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions. 2. Classical Communication: We show that PRS generators with logarithmic output length imply commitment and encryption schemes with classical communication. Previous constructions of such schemes from PRS generators required quantum communication. 3. Simplified Proof: We give a simpler proof of the Brakerski--Shmueli (TCC'19) result that polynomially-many copies of uniform superposition states with random binary phases are indistinguishable from Haar-random states. 4. Necessity of Computational Assumptions: We also show that a secure PRS with output length logarithmic, or larger, in the key length necessarily requires computational assumptions.</description>

    <title>Quantum algorithms for classical Boolean functions via adaptive measurements: Exponential reductions in space-time resources</title>

    <description>The limited computational power of constant-depth quantum circuits can be boosted by adapting future gates according to the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements. We formulate computation of a variety of Boolean functions in the framework of adaptive measurement-based quantum computation using a cluster state resource and a classical side-processor that can add bits modulo 2, so-called $l2$-MBQC. Our adaptive approach overcomes a known challenge that computing these functions in the nonadaptive setting requires a resource state that is exponentially large in the size of the computational input. In particular, we construct adaptive $l2$-MBQC algorithms based on the quantum signal processing technique that compute the mod-$p$ functions with the best known scaling in the space-time resources (i.e., qubit count, quantum circuit depth, classical memory size, and number of calls to the side-processor). As the subject is diverse and has a long history, the paper includes reviews of several previously constructed algorithms and recasts them as adaptive $l2$-MBQCs using cluster state resources. Our results constitute an alternative proof of an old theorem regarding an oracular separation between the power of constant-depth quantum circuits and constant-depth classical circuits with unbounded fan-in NAND and mod-$p$ gates for any prime $p$.</description>

    <title>A Complete Hierarchy of Linear Systems for Certifying Quantum Entanglement of Subspaces</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16389</link>
    <author>Nathaniel Johnston, Benjamin Lovitz, Aravindan Vijayaraghavan</author>
    <pubDate>Nov 01 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We introduce a hierarchy of linear systems for showing that a given subspace of pure quantum states is entangled (i.e., contains no product states). This hierarchy outperforms known methods already at the first level, and it is complete in the sense that every entangled subspace is shown to be so at some finite level of the hierarchy. It generalizes straightforwardly to the case of higher Schmidt rank, as well as the multipartite cases of completely and genuinely entangled subspaces. These hierarchies work extremely well in practice even in very large quantum systems, as they can be implemented via elementary linear algebra techniques rather than the semidefinite programming techniques that are required by previously-known hierarchies.</description>

    <title>Finite temperature tensor network algorithm for frustrated two-dimensional quantum materials</title>

    <description>Aimed at a more realistic classical description of natural quantum systems, we present a two-dimensional tensor network algorithm to study finite temperature properties of frustrated model quantum systems and real quantum materials. For this purpose, we introduce the infinite projected entangled simplex operator ansatz to study thermodynamic properties. To obtain state-of-the-art benchmarking results, we explore the highly challenging spin-1/2 Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on the Kagome lattice, a system for which we investigate the melting of the magnetization plateaus at finite magnetic field and temperature. Making close connection to actual experimental data of real quantum materials, we go on to studying the finite temperature properties of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. We compare the magnetization curve of this material in the presence of an external magnetic field at finite temperature with classically simulated data. As a first theoretical tool that incorporates both thermal fluctuations as well as quantum correlations in the study of this material, our work contributes to settling the existing controversy between the experimental data and previous theoretical works on the magnetization process.</description>

    <title>Non-Abelian Floquet Spin Liquids in a Digital Rydberg Simulator</title>

    <description>Understanding topological matter is an outstanding challenge across several disciplines of physical science. Programmable quantum simulators have emerged as a powerful approach to studying such systems. While quantum spin liquids of paradigmatic toric code type have recently been realized in the laboratory, controlled exploration of topological phases with non-abelian excitations remains an open problem. We introduce and analyze a new approach to simulating topological matter based on periodic driving. Specifically, we describe a model for a so-called Floquet spin liquid, obtained through a periodic sequence of parallel quantum gate operations that effectively simulates the Hamiltonian of the non-abelian spin liquid in Kitaev's honeycomb model. We show that this approach, including the toolbox for preparation, control, and readout of topological states, can be efficiently implemented in state-of-the-art experimental platforms. One specific implementation scheme is based on Rydberg atom arrays and utilizes recently demonstrated coherent qubit transport combined with controlled-phase gate operations. We describe methods for probing the non-abelian excitations, and the associated Majorana zero modes, and simulate possible fusion and braiding experiments. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of programmable quantum simulators for exploring topological phases of matter. Extensions including simulation of Kitaev materials and lattice gauge theories are also discussed.</description>

    <title>On the practical usefulness of the Hardware Efficient Ansatz</title>

    <description>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models train a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a given learning task. The success of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz for the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the one-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to minimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives. The use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact that while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid them at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should, or should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs should likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume law of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where shallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an area law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as Gaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that in these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an anti-concentration of loss function values. Our work highlights the crucial role that input states play in the trainability of a parametrized quantum circuit, a phenomenon that is verified in our numerics.</description>

    <title>Ground state degeneracy on torus in a family of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00299</link>

    <description>Topologically ordered phases in $2+1$ dimensions are generally characterized by three mutually-related features: fractionalized (anyonic) excitations, topological entanglement entropy, and robust ground state degeneracy that does not require symmetry protection or spontaneous symmetry breaking. Such degeneracy is known as topological degeneracy and usually can be seen under the periodic boundary condition regardless of the choice of the system size $L_1$ and $L_2$ in each direction. In this work we introduce a family of extensions of the Kitaev toric code to $N$ level spins ($N\geq2$). The model realizes topologically ordered phases or symmetry-protected topological phases depending on parameters in the model. The most remarkable feature of the topologically ordered phases is that the ground state may be unique, depending on $L_1$ and $L_2$, despite that the translation symmetry of the model remains unbroken. Nonetheless, the topological entanglement entropy takes the nontrivial value. We argue that this behavior originates from the nontrivial action of translations permuting anyon species.</description>

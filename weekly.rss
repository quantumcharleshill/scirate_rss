    <title>Multivariate trace estimation in constant quantum depth</title>

    <description>There is a folkloric belief that a depth-$\Theta(m)$ quantum circuit is needed to estimate the trace of the product of $m$ density matrices (i.e., a multivariate trace). We prove that this belief is overly conservative by constructing a constant quantum-depth circuit for the task, inspired by the method of Shor error correction. Furthermore, our circuit demands only local gates in a two dimensional circuit -- we show how to implement it in a highly parallelized way on an architecture similar to that of Google's Sycamore processor. With these features, our algorithm brings the task of multivariate trace estimation, crucial to applications in condensed matter and estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states, closer to the capabilities of near-term quantum processors. We instantiate the latter application with a theorem on estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states with ``well-behaved" polynomial approximations.</description>

    <title>Succinct Classical Verification of Quantum Computation</title>

    <description>We construct a classically verifiable succinct interactive argument for quantum computation (BQP) with communication complexity and verifier runtime that are poly-logarithmic in the runtime of the BQP computation (and polynomial in the security parameter). Our protocol is secure assuming the post-quantum security of indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and Learning with Errors (LWE). This is the first succinct argument for quantum computation in the plain model; prior work (Chia-Chung-Yamakawa, TCC '20) requires both a long common reference string and non-black-box use of a hash function modeled as a random oracle. At a technical level, we revisit the framework for constructing classically verifiable quantum computation (Mahadev, FOCS '18). We give a self-contained, modular proof of security for Mahadev's protocol, which we believe is of independent interest. Our proof readily generalizes to a setting in which the verifier's first message (which consists of many public keys) is compressed. Next, we formalize this notion of compressed public keys; we view the object as a generalization of constrained/programmable PRFs and instantiate it based on indistinguishability obfuscation. Finally, we compile the above protocol into a fully succinct argument using a (sufficiently composable) succinct argument of knowledge for NP. Using our framework, we achieve several additional results, including - Succinct arguments for QMA (given multiple copies of the witness), - Succinct non-interactive arguments for BQP (or QMA) in the quantum random oracle model, and - Succinct batch arguments for BQP (or QMA) assuming post-quantum LWE (without iO).</description>

    <title>Syndrome-Derived Error Rates as a Benchmark of Quantum Hardware</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00553</link>
    <author>James R. Wootton</author>

    <description>Quantum error correcting codes are designed to pinpoint exactly when and where errors occur in quantum circuits. This feature is the foundation of their primary task: to support fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, this feature could used as the basis of benchmarking: By analyzing the outputs of even small-scale quantum error correction circuits, a detailed picture can be constructed of error processes across a quantum device. Here we perform an example of such an analysis, using the results of small repetition codes to determine the error rate of each qubit while idle during a syndrome measurement. This provides an idea of the errors experienced by the qubits across a device while they are part of the kind of circuit that we expect to be typical in fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

    <title>Uncertainty relations from graph theory</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02197</link>
    <author>Carlos de Gois, Kiara Hansenne, Otfried Gühne</author>
    <pubDate>Jul 06 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Quantum measurements are inherently probabilistic. Further defying our classical intuition, quantum theory often forbids us to precisely determine the outcomes of simultaneous measurements. This phenomenon is captured and quantified through uncertainty relations. Although studied since the inception of quantum theory, this problem of determining the possible expectation values of a collection of quantum measurements remains, in general, unsolved. By constructing a close connection between observables and graph theory, we derive uncertainty relations valid for any set of dichotomic observables. These relations are, in many cases, tight, and related to the size of the maximum clique of the associated graph. As applications, they can be straightforwardly used to build entropic uncertainty relations, separability criteria and entanglement witnesses.</description>

    <title>Classification of measurement-based quantum wire in stabilizer PEPS</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00616</link>
    <author>Paul Herringer, Robert Raussendorf</author>
    <pubDate>Jul 05 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We consider a class of translation-invariant 2D tensor network states with a stabilizer symmetry, which we call stabilizer PEPS. The cluster state, GHZ state, and states in the toric code belong to this class. We investigate the transmission capacity of stabilizer PEPS for measurement-based quantum wire, and arrive at a complete classification of transmission behaviors. The transmission behaviors fall into 13 classes, one of which corresponds to Clifford quantum cellular automata. In addition, we identify 12 other classes.</description>

    <title>Exact electronic states with shallow quantum circuits through global optimisation</title>

    <description>Quantum computers promise to revolutionise electronic simulations by overcoming the exponential scaling of many-electron problems. While electronic wave functions can be represented using a product of fermionic unitary operators, shallow quantum circuits for exact states have not yet been achieved. We construct universal wave functions from gate-efficient, symmetry-preserving fermionic operators by introducing an algorithm that globally optimises the wave function in the discrete ansatz design and the continuous parameter spaces. Our approach maximises the accuracy that can be obtained with near-term quantum circuits. Highly accurate numerical simulations on strongly correlated molecules, including water and molecular nitrogen, and the condensed-matter Hubbard model, demonstrate that our algorithm reliably advances the state-of-the-art, defining a new paradigm for quantum simulations featuring strong electron correlation.</description>

    <title>Quantum mechanics? It's all fun and games until someone loses an $i$</title>

    <description>QBism regards quantum mechanics as an addition to probability theory. The addition provides an extra normative rule for decision-making agents concerned with gambling across experimental contexts, somewhat in analogy to the double-slit experiment. This establishes the meaning of the Born Rule from a QBist perspective. Moreover it suggests that the best way to formulate the Born Rule for foundational discussions is with respect to an informationally complete reference device. Recent work [DeBrota, Fuchs, and Stacey, Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 013074 (2020)] has demonstrated that reference devices employing symmetric informationally complete POVMs (or SICs) achieve a minimal quantumness: They witness the irreducible difference between classical and quantum. In this paper, we attempt to answer the analogous question for real-vector-space quantum theory. While standard quantum mechanics seems to allow SICs to exist in all finite dimensions, in the case of quantum theory over the real numbers it is known that SICs do not exist in most dimensions. We therefore attempt to identify the optimal reference device in the first real dimension without a SIC (i.e., $d=4$) in hopes of better understanding the essential role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics. In contrast to their complex counterparts, the expressions that result in a QBist understanding of real-vector-space quantum theory are surprisingly complex.</description>

    <title>Efficient Verification of Ground States of Frustration-Free Hamiltonians</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15292</link>

    <description>Ground states of local Hamiltonians are of key interest in many-body physics and also in quantum information processing. Efficient verification of these states are crucial to many applications, but are very challenging. Here we propose a simple, but powerful recipe for verifying the ground states of general frustration-free Hamiltonians based on local measurements. Moreover, we derive rigorous bounds on the sampling complexity by virtue of the quantum detectability lemma (with improvement) and quantum union bound. Notably, the number of samples required does not increase with the system size when the underlying Hamiltonian is local and gapped, which is the case of most interest. As an application, we propose a general approach for verifying Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) states on arbitrary graphs based on spin measurements, which require only a constant number of samples for AKLT states defined on various lattices. Our work is of interest not only to many tasks in quantum information processing, but also to the study of many-body physics.</description>

    <title>Cryptography with Certified Deletion</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01754</link>
    <author>James Bartusek, Dakshita Khurana</author>
    <pubDate>Jul 06 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We propose a new, unifying framework that yields an array of cryptographic primitives with certified deletion. These primitives enable a party in possession of a quantum ciphertext to generate a classical certificate that the encrypted plaintext has been information-theoretically deleted, and cannot be recovered even given unbounded computational resources. For any $X \in \{\mathsf{public}\text{-}\mathsf{key},\mathsf{attribute\text{-}based},\mathsf{fully\text{-}homomorphic}, \mathsf{witness},\mathsf{timed}\text{-}\mathsf{release}\}$, our compiler yields post-quantum $X$ encryption with certified deletion, assuming post-quantum $X$ encryption. In addition, assuming the existence of statistically binding commitments, our compiler yields statistically binding commitments with certified everlasting hiding as well as statistically sound zero-knowledge proofs for QMA with certified everlasting zero-knowledge. We also introduce and construct information-theoretic secret sharing with certified deletion. Existing proposals~\citeEC:Unruh14,10.1007/978-3-030-92062-3_21,cryptoeprint:2021:1315,cryptoeprint:2022:295 for public-key primitives and commitments with certified deletion (1) have complex constructions tailored to specific primitives and non-generic proofs, (2) are not known to satisfy everlasting security after deletion in the plain model, and in many cases (3) resort to idealized models or stronger cryptographic assumptions like obfuscation. We remedy this situation by developing a novel proof technique to argue that a bit $b$ has been \em information-theoretically deleted from an adversary's view once they produce a valid deletion certificate, despite having been previously \em determined by the ciphertext they held in their view. This may be of independent interest.</description>

    <title>Neural network enhanced measurement efficiency for molecular groundstates</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.15449</link>

    <description>It is believed that one of the first useful applications for a quantum computer will be the preparation of groundstates of molecular Hamiltonians. A crucial task involving state preparation and readout is obtaining physical observables of such states, which are typically estimated using projective measurements on the qubits. At present, measurement data is costly and time-consuming to obtain on any quantum computing architecture, which has significant consequences for the statistical errors of estimators. In this paper, we adapt common neural network models (restricted Boltzmann machines and recurrent neural networks) to learn complex groundstate wavefunctions for several prototypical molecular qubit Hamiltonians from typical measurement data. By relating the accuracy $\varepsilon$ of the reconstructed groundstate energy to the number of measurements, we find that using a neural network model provides a robust improvement over using single-copy measurement outcomes alone to reconstruct observables. This enhancement yields an asymptotic scaling near $\varepsilon^{-1}$ for the model-based approaches, as opposed to $\varepsilon^{-2}$ in the case of classical shadow tomography.</description>

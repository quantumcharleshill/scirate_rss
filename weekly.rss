    <title>NLTS Hamiltonians from good quantum codes</title>

    <description>The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of non-trivial complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). We prove this conjecture by showing that the recently discovered families of constant-rate and linear-distance QLDPC codes correspond to NLTS local Hamiltonians.</description>

    <title>A Pair Measurement Surface Code on Pentagons</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12780</link>

    <description>In this paper, I present a way to compile the surface code into two-body parity measurements ("pair measurements"), where the pair measurements run along the edges of a Cairo pentagonal tiling. The resulting circuit improves on prior work by Chao et al. by using fewer pair measurements per four-body stabilizer measurement (5 instead of 6) and fewer time steps per round of stabilizer measurement (6 instead of 10). Using Monte Carlo sampling, I show that these improvements increase the threshold of the surface code when compiling into pair measurements from $\approx 0.2\%$ to $\approx 0.4\%$, and also that they improve the teraquop footprint at a $0.1\%$ physical gate error rate from $\approx6000$ qubits to $\approx3000$ qubits. However, I also show that Chao et al's construction will have a smaller teraquop footprint for physical gate error rates below $\approx 0.03\%$ (due to bidirectional hook errors in my construction). I also compare to the planar honeycomb code, showing that although this work does noticeably reduce the gap between the surface code and the honeycomb code (when compiling into pair measurements), the honeycomb code is still more efficient (threshold $\approx 0.8\%$, teraquop footprint at $0.1\%$ of $\approx 1000$).</description>

    <title>Measurement as a shortcut to long-range entangled quantum matter</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13527</link>

    <description>The preparation of long-range entangled states using unitary circuits is limited by Lieb-Robinson bounds, but circuits with projective measurements and feedback (``adaptive circuits'') can evade such restrictions. We introduce four classes of local adaptive circuits that enable low-depth preparation of long-range entangled quantum matter characterized by gapped topological orders and conformal field theories (CFTs). The four classes are inspired by distinct physical insights, including tensor-network constructions, short-range entangled states with non-trivial braiding structures, multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), and parton constructions. A large class of topological orders, including chiral and symmetry-enriched topological orders, can be prepared in constant depth or time, and one-dimensional CFT states and non-abelian topological orders with both solvable and non-solvable groups can be prepared in depth scaling logarithmically with system size. Our work illustrates the practical and conceptual versatility of measurement for state preparation.</description>

    <title>Detecting and Eliminating Quantum Noise of Quantum Measurements</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13743</link>

    <description>In this work, we propose a two-stage procedure to systematically address quantum noise inherent in quantum measurements. The idea behind it is intuitive: we first detect and then eliminate quantum noise so that the classical noise assumption is satisfied and measurement error mitigation works. In the first stage, inspired by coherence witness in the resource theory of quantum coherence, we design an efficient method to detect quantum noise. It works by fitting the difference between two measurement statistics to the Fourier series, where the statistics are obtained using maximally coherent states with relative phase and maximally mixed states as inputs. The fitting coefficients quantitatively benchmark quantum noise. In the second stage, we design various methods to eliminate quantum noise, inspired by the Pauli twirling technique. They work by executing randomly sampled Pauli gates before the measurement device and conditionally flipping the measurement outcomes in such a way that the effective measurement device contains only classical noise. We demonstrate the feasibility of the two-stage procedure numerically on Baidu Quantum Platform. Remarkably, the results show that quantum noise in measurement devices is significantly suppressed, and the quantum computation accuracy is substantially improved. We highlight that the two-stage procedure complements existing measurement error mitigation techniques, and they together form a standard toolbox for manipulating measurement errors in near-term quantum devices.</description>

    <title>Time and Query Complexity Tradeoff for the Dihedral Coset Problem</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14408</link>
    <author>Maxime Remaud, jean-Pierre Tillich</author>

    <description>The Dihedral Coset Problem (DCP) in $Z_N$ is an important quantumly defined problem to which for instance the learning with errors problem reduces.There are several algorithms for solving it. On one hand, we have algorithms \textità la Ettinger-Høyer running in $\OO{2^{c_{\SS}\log{N}}}$ time but using $\OO{\log{N}}$ queries, for some constant $c_{\SS}$. On the other hand, algorithms \textità la Kuperberg need $\OOt{2^{\sqrt{c_{\DCP}\log{N}}}}$ time and queries, for some constant $c_{\DCP}$. Despite being the subject of a lot of studies, no algorithm using an intermediate number of queries was known up till now. It means that an attacker who has, for cost or time reasons, limited queries, will be forced to use a linear query algorithm running in exponential time. We propose an algorithm taking as a parameter the number $Q$ of queries we are allowed to do, therefore interpolating between existing algorithms. We thus explicitly show that it takes $\OOt{2^{c_{\SS}\left(\log{N}-\frac{1}{c_{\DCP}}\log^2{Q}\right)}}$ time. Our algorithm improves over algorithms \textità la Ettinger-Høyer when $Q$ is minimal and matches algorithms \textità la Kuperberg when $Q$ is maximal, while offering new possibilities in between. The key point of our algorithm is to give a degree of freedom in the way coset states are preprocessed, that we then link to the parameter $Q$ to obtain an optimal algorithm with respect to $Q$. We also introduce a new sieving procedure to assemble the constructed coset states, allowing us to retrieve the secret $s$.</description>

    <title>From Tensor Network Quantum States to Tensorial Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12363</link>
    <author>Dian Wu, Riccardo Rossi, Filippo Vicentini, Giuseppe Carleo</author>
    <pubDate>Jun 27 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We show that any matrix product state (MPS) can be exactly represented by a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a linear memory update. We generalize this RNN architecture to 2D lattices using a multilinear memory update. It supports perfect sampling and wave function evaluation in polynomial time, and can represent an area law of entanglement entropy. Numerical evidence shows that it can encode the wave function using a bond dimension lower by orders of magnitude when compared to MPS, with an accuracy that can be systematically improved by increasing the bond dimension.</description>

    <title>Non-Convex Optimization by Hamiltonian Alternation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14072</link>
    <author>Anuj Apte, Kunal Marwaha, Arvind Murugan</author>
    <pubDate>Jun 29 2022</pubDate>
    <description>A major obstacle to non-convex optimization is the problem of getting stuck in local minima. We introduce a novel metaheuristic to handle this issue, creating an alternate Hamiltonian that shares minima with the original Hamiltonian only within a chosen energy range. We find that repeatedly minimizing each Hamiltonian in sequence allows an algorithm to escape local minima. This technique is particularly straightforward when the ground state energy is known, and one obtains an improvement even without this knowledge. We demonstrate this technique by using it to find the ground state for instances of a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass.</description>

    <title>Positive-definite parametrization of mixed quantum states with deep neural networks</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13488</link>
    <author>Filippo Vicentini, Riccardo Rossi, Giuseppe Carleo</author>
    <pubDate>Jun 28 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We introduce the Gram-Hadamard Density Operator (GHDO), a new deep neural-network architecture that can encode positive semi-definite density operators of exponential rank with polynomial resources. We then show how to embed an autoregressive structure in the GHDO to allow direct sampling of the probability distribution. These properties are especially important when representing and variationally optimizing the mixed quantum state of a system interacting with an environment. Finally, we benchmark this architecture by simulating the steady state of the dissipative transverse-field Ising model. Estimating local observables and the Rényi entropy, we show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art variational approaches.</description>

    <title>Quantum Regularized Least Squares</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13143</link>

    <description>Linear regression is a widely used technique to fit linear models and finds widespread applications across different areas such as machine learning and statistics. In most real-world scenarios, however, linear regression problems are often ill-posed or the underlying model suffers from overfitting, leading to erroneous or trivial solutions. This is often dealt with by adding extra constraints, known as regularization. In this paper, we use the frameworks of block-encoding and quantum singular value transformation to design new quantum algorithms for quantum least squares with general $\ell_2$-regularization. These include regularized versions of quantum ordinary least squares, quantum weighted least squares, and quantum generalized least squares. Our quantum algorithms substantially improve upon prior results on quantum ridge regression (the regularization term is proportional to the $\ell_2$-norm of the least squares solution), which is a particular case of our result. To this end, we assume approximate block-encodings of the underlying matrices as input and use robust QSVT algorithms for various linear algebra operations. In particular, we develop a variable-time quantum algorithm for matrix inversion using QSVT, where we use quantum eigenvalue discrimination as a subroutine instead of gapped phase estimation. This ensures that fewer additional qubits are required for this procedure than prior results. Owing to the generality of the block-encoding framework, our algorithms can be implemented on a variety of input models and can also be seen as improved and generalized versions of the standard (non-regularized) quantum least squares algorithms of Chakraborty et al. [ICALP 2019].</description>

    <title>Concentration Inequalities for Output Statistics of Quantum Markov Processes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14223</link>
    <author>Federico Girotti, Juan P. Garrahan, Mădălin Guţă</author>
    <pubDate>Jun 30 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We derive new concentration bounds for time averages of measurement outcomes in quantum Markov processes. This generalizes well-known bounds for classical Markov chains which provide constraints on finite time fluctuations of time-additive quantities around their averages. We employ spectral, perturbation and martingale techniques, together with noncommutative $L_2$ theory, to derive: (i) a Bernstein-type concentration bound for time averages of the measurement outcomes of a quantum Markov chain, (ii) a Hoeffding-type concentration bound for the same process, (iii) a generalization of the Bernstein-type concentration bound for counting processes of continuous time quantum Markov processes, (iv) new concentration bounds for empirical fluxes of classical Markov chains which broaden the range of applicability of the corresponding classical bounds beyond empirical averages. We also suggests potential application of our results to parameter estimation and consider extensions to reducible quantum channels, multi-time statistics and time-dependent measurements, and comment on the connection to so-called thermodynamic uncertainty relations.</description>

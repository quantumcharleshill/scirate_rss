    <title>Learning to predict arbitrary quantum processes</title>

    <description>We present an efficient machine learning (ML) algorithm for predicting any unknown quantum process $\mathcal{E}$ over $n$ qubits. For a wide range of distributions $\mathcal{D}$ on arbitrary $n$-qubit states, we show that this ML algorithm can learn to predict any local property of the output from the unknown process $\mathcal{E}$, with a small average error over input states drawn from $\mathcal{D}$. The ML algorithm is computationally efficient even when the unknown process is a quantum circuit with exponentially many gates. Our algorithm combines efficient procedures for learning properties of an unknown state and for learning a low-degree approximation to an unknown observable. The analysis hinges on proving new norm inequalities, including a quantum analogue of the classical Bohnenblust-Hille inequality, which we derive by giving an improved algorithm for optimizing local Hamiltonians. Overall, our results highlight the potential for ML models to predict the output of complex quantum dynamics much faster than the time needed to run the process itself.</description>

    <title>Quantum state preparation without coherent arithmetic</title>

    <description>We introduce a versatile method for preparing a quantum state whose amplitudes are given by some known function. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require handcrafted reversible arithmetic circuits, or quantum memory loads, to encode the function values. Instead, we use a template quantum eigenvalue transformation circuit to convert a low cost block encoding of the sine function into the desired function. Our method uses only 4 ancilla qubits (3 if the approximating polynomial has definite parity), providing order-of-magnitude qubit count reductions compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while using a similar number of Toffoli gates if the function can be well represented by a polynomial or Fourier approximation. Like black-box methods, the complexity of our approach depends on the 'L2-norm filling-fraction' of the function. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method for preparing states commonly used in quantum algorithms, such as Gaussian and Kaiser window states.</description>

    <title>A classical oracle separation between QMA and QCMA</title>

    <description>It is a long-standing open question in quantum complexity theory whether the definition of $\textit{non-deterministic}$ quantum computation requires quantum witnesses $(\textsf{QMA})$ or if classical witnesses suffice $(\textsf{QCMA})$. We make progress on this question by constructing a randomized classical oracle separating the respective computational complexity classes. Previous separations [Aaronson-Kuperberg (CCC'07), Fefferman-Kimmel (MFCS'18)] required a quantum unitary oracle. The separating problem is deciding whether a distribution supported on regular un-directed graphs either consists of multiple connected components (yes instances) or consists of one expanding connected component (no instances) where the graph is given in an adjacency-list format by the oracle. Therefore, the oracle is a distribution over $n$-bit boolean functions.</description>

    <title>Autonomous quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation with squeezed cat qubits</title>

    <description>We propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme using squeezed cat (SC) code against the dominant error source, excitation loss, in continuous-variable systems. Through reservoir engineering, we show that a structured dissipation can stabilize a two-component SC while autonomously correcting the errors. The implementation of such dissipation only requires low-order nonlinear couplings among three bosonic modes or between a bosonic mode and a qutrit. While our proposed scheme is device independent, it is readily implementable with current experimental platforms such as superconducting circuits and trapped-ion systems. Compared to the stabilized cat, the stabilized SC has a much lower dominant error rate and a significantly enhanced noise bias. Furthermore, the bias-preserving operations for the SC have much lower error rates. In combination, the stabilized SC leads to substantially better logical performance when concatenating with an outer discrete-variable code. The surface-SC scheme achieves more than one order of magnitude increase in the threshold ratio between the loss rate $\kappa_1$ and the engineered dissipation rate $\kappa_2$. Under a practical noise ratio $\kappa_1/\kappa_2 = 10^{-3}$, the repetition-SC scheme can reach a $10^{-15}$ logical error rate even with a small mean excitation number of 4, which already suffices for practically useful quantum algorithms.</description>

    <description>Density modelling is the task of learning an unknown probability density function from samples, and is one of the central problems of unsupervised machine learning. In this work, we show that there exists a density modelling problem for which fault-tolerant quantum computers can offer a super-polynomial advantage over classical learning algorithms, given standard cryptographic assumptions. Along the way, we provide a variety of additional results and insights, of potential interest for proving future distribution learning separations between quantum and classical learning algorithms. Specifically, we (a) provide an overview of the relationships between hardness results in supervised learning and distribution learning, and (b) show that any weak pseudo-random function can be used to construct a classically hard density modelling problem. The latter result opens up the possibility of proving quantum-classical separations for density modelling based on weaker assumptions than those necessary for pseudo-random functions.</description>

    <description>The intensive pursuit for quantum algorithms with speedup in terms of computational complexity has further led to this modernized crucial question: \it When and how will quantum computers outperform classical computers?. The next milestone in the context of this quantum transcendence is undoubtedly the realization of quantum acceleration in practical problems. Here we provide a clear evidence and arguments that the primary target is likely to be condensed matter physics. Our primary contributions are summarized as follows: 1) Proposal of systematic error/runtime analysis on state-of-the-art classical algorithm based on tensor networks; 2) Dedicated and high-resolution analysis on quantum resource performed at the level of executable logical instructions; 3) Clarification of quantum-classical crosspoint for ground-state simulation to be within runtime of hours using only a few hundreds of thousand physical qubits for 2d Heisenberg and 2d Fermi-Hubbard models. To our knowledge, we argue that condensed matter problems offer the earliest platform for demonstration of practical quantum advantage that is order-of-magnitude more feasible than ever known candidates, in terms of both qubit counts and total runtime.</description>

    <title>Discrete Bulk Reconstruction</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15601</link>

    <description>According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries -- indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has $O(N^2)$ vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it's ``universal,'' with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an ``inverse'' of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a ``bulkless'' graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries -- where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes -- including an upper bound of $O(N^4)$ vertices whenever a planar bulk graph exists (thus putting the problem into the complexity class $\mathsf{NP}$).</description>

    <title>Quantum error correction with metastable states of trapped ions using erasure conversion</title>

    <description>Erasures, or errors with known locations, are a more favorable type of error for quantum error-correcting codes than Pauli errors. Converting physical noise into erasures can significantly improve the performance of quantum error correction. Here we apply the idea of performing erasure conversion by encoding qubits into metastable atomic states, proposed by Wu, Kolkowitz, Puri, and Thompson [Nat. Comm. 13, 4657 (2022)], to trapped ions. We suggest an erasure-conversion scheme for metastable trapped-ion qubits and develop a detailed model of various types of errors. We then compare the logical performance of ground and metastable qubits on the surface code under various physical constraints and discuss the trade offs.</description>

    <title>Measurements of Floquet code plaquette stabilizers</title>

    <description>The recently introduced Floquet codes have already inspired several follow up works in terms of theory and simulation. Here we report the first preliminary results on their experimental implementation, using IBM Quantum hardware. Specifically, we implement the stabilizer measurements of the original Floquet code based on the honeycomb lattice model, as well as the more recently introduced Floquet Color code. The stabilizers of these are measured on a variety of systems, with the rate of syndrome changes used as a proxy for the noise of the device.</description>

    <title>Holography as a resource for non-local quantum computation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13500</link>

    <description>If two parties share sufficient entanglement, they are able to implement any channel on a shared bipartite state via non-local quantum computation -- a protocol consisting of local operations and a single simultaneous round of quantum communication. Such a protocol can occur in the AdS/CFT correspondence, with the two parties represented by regions of the CFT, and the holographic state serving as a resource to provide the necessary entanglement. This boundary non-local computation is dual to the local implementation of a channel in the bulk AdS theory. Previous work on this phenomenon was obstructed by the divergent entanglement between adjacent CFT regions, and tried to circumvent this issue by assuming that certain regions are irrelevant. However, the absence of these regions introduces violent phenomena that prevent the CFT from implementing the protocol. Instead, we resolve the issue of divergent entanglement by using a finite-memory quantum simulation of the CFT. We show that any finite-memory quantum system on a circular lattice yields a protocol for non-local quantum computation. In the case of a quantum simulation of a holographic CFT, we carefully show that this protocol implements the channel performed by the local bulk dynamics. Under plausible physical assumptions about quantum computation in the bulk, our results imply that non-local quantum computation can be performed for any polynomially complex unitary with a polynomial amount of entanglement. Finally, we provide a concrete example of a holographic code whose bulk dynamics correspond to a Clifford gate, and use our results to show that this corresponds to a non-local quantum computation protocol for this gate.</description>

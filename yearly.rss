    <description>Quantum algorithms offer significant speedups over their classical counterparts for a variety of problems. The strongest arguments for this advantage are borne by algorithms for quantum search, quantum phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, which appear as subroutines for large families of composite quantum algorithms. A number of these quantum algorithms were recently tied together by a novel technique known as the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), which enables one to perform a polynomial transformation of the singular values of a linear operator embedded in a unitary matrix. In the seminal GSLW'19 paper on QSVT [Gilyén, Su, Low, and Wiebe, ACM STOC 2019], many algorithms are encompassed, including amplitude amplification, methods for the quantum linear systems problem, and quantum simulation. Here, we provide a pedagogical tutorial through these developments, first illustrating how quantum signal processing may be generalized to the quantum eigenvalue transform, from which QSVT naturally emerges. Paralleling GSLW'19, we then employ QSVT to construct intuitive quantum algorithms for search, phase estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, and also showcase algorithms for the eigenvalue threshold problem and matrix inversion. This overview illustrates how QSVT is a single framework comprising the three major quantum algorithms, thus suggesting a grand unification of quantum algorithms.</description>

    <description>Classical machine learning (ML) provides a potentially powerful approach to solving challenging quantum many-body problems in physics and chemistry. However, the advantages of ML over more traditional methods have not been firmly established. In this work, we prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently predict ground state properties of gapped Hamiltonians in finite spatial dimensions, after learning from data obtained by measuring other Hamiltonians in the same quantum phase of matter. In contrast, under widely accepted complexity theory assumptions, classical algorithms that do not learn from data cannot achieve the same guarantee. We also prove that classical ML algorithms can efficiently classify a wide range of quantum phases of matter. Our arguments are based on the concept of a classical shadow, a succinct classical description of a many-body quantum state that can be constructed in feasible quantum experiments and be used to predict many properties of the state. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results in a variety of scenarios, including Rydberg atom systems, 2D random Heisenberg models, symmetry-protected topological phases, and topologically ordered phases.</description>

    <description>We propose a general tensor network method for simulating quantum circuits. The method is massively more efficient in computing a large number of correlated bitstring amplitudes and probabilities than existing methods. As an application, we study the sampling problem of Google's Sycamore circuits, which are believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and have been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. Using our method, employing a small computational cluster containing 60 graphical processing units (GPUs), we have generated one million correlated bitstrings with some entries fixed, from the Sycamore circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles, with linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) fidelity equals 0.739, which is much higher than those in Google's quantum supremacy experiments.</description>

    <description>A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve efficiently problems such as integer factorization and unstructured database search requires millions of qubits with low error rates and long coherence times. While the experimental advancement towards realizing such devices will potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy qubits, i.e. qubits that are not error-corrected, and therefore perform imperfect operations in a limited coherence time. In the search for quantum advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry and combinatorial optimization. The goal of such algorithms is to leverage the limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of NISQ computational paradigms and algorithms. We discuss the key structure of these algorithms, their limitations, and advantages. We additionally provide a comprehensive overview of various benchmarking and software tools useful for programming and testing NISQ devices.</description>

    <title>Efficient estimation of Pauli observables by derandomization</title>

    <description>We consider the problem of jointly estimating expectation values of many Pauli observables, a crucial subroutine in variational quantum algorithms. Starting with randomized measurements, we propose an efficient derandomization procedure that iteratively replaces random single-qubit measurements with fixed Pauli measurements; the resulting deterministic measurement procedure is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the randomized one. In particular, for estimating any $L$ low-weight Pauli observables, a deterministic measurement on only of order $\log(L)$ copies of a quantum state suffices. In some cases, for example when some of the Pauli observables have a high weight, the derandomized procedure is substantially better than the randomized one. Specifically, numerical experiments highlight the advantages of our derandomized protocol over various previous methods for estimating the ground-state energies of small molecules.</description>

    <description>Quantifying quantum states' complexity is a key problem in various subfields of science, from quantum computing to black-hole physics. We prove a prominent conjecture by Brown and Susskind about how random quantum circuits' complexity increases. Consider constructing a unitary from Haar-random two-qubit quantum gates. Implementing the unitary exactly requires a circuit of some minimal number of gates - the unitary's exact circuit complexity. We prove that this complexity grows linearly with the number of random gates, with unit probability, until saturating after exponentially many random gates. Our proof is surprisingly short, given the established difficulty of lower-bounding the exact circuit complexity. Our strategy combines differential topology and elementary algebraic geometry with an inductive construction of Clifford circuits.</description>

    <description>Quantum technology has the potential to revolutionize how we acquire and process experimental data to learn about the physical world. An experimental setup that transduces data from a physical system to a stable quantum memory, and processes that data using a quantum computer, could have significant advantages over conventional experiments in which the physical system is measured and the outcomes are processed using a classical computer. We prove that, in various tasks, quantum machines can learn from exponentially fewer experiments than those required in conventional experiments. The exponential advantage holds in predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics. In some tasks, the quantum processing needed to achieve the exponential advantage can be modest; for example, one can simultaneously learn about many noncommuting observables by processing only two copies of the system. Conducting experiments with up to 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrate that a substantial quantum advantage can be realized using today's relatively noisy quantum processors. Our results highlight how quantum technology can enable powerful new strategies to learn about nature.</description>

    <title>Training variational quantum algorithms is NP-hard -- even for logarithmically many qubits and free fermionic systems</title>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are proposed to solve relevant computational problems on near term quantum devices. Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) and quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs) that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea to use a classical computer to train a parameterized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that for every polynomial time algorithm, there exists instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large, unless P = NP. Even for classically tractable systems, composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show that the optimization is NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima. This means gradient and higher order decent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.</description>

    <description>We study classical and quantum LDPC codes of constant rate obtained by the lifted product construction over non-abelian groups. We show that the obtained families of quantum LDPC codes are asymptotically good, which proves the qLDPC conjecture. Moreover, we show that the produced classical LDPC codes are also asymptotically good and locally testable with constant query and soundness parameters, which proves a well-known conjecture in the field of locally testable codes.</description>

    <description>The partition function and free energy of a quantum many-body system determine its physical properties in thermal equilibrium. Here we study the computational complexity of approximating these quantities for $n$-qubit local Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ runtime which approximates the free energy of a given $2$-local Hamiltonian provided that it satisfies a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex relaxation methods. It contributes to a body of work on efficient approximation algorithms for dense instances of optimization problems which are hard in the general case, and can be viewed as simultaneously extending existing algorithms for (a) the ground energy of dense $2$-local Hamiltonians, and (b) the free energy of dense classical Ising models. Secondly, we establish polynomial-time equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local Hamiltonians and three other natural quantum approximate counting problems, including the problem of approximating the number of witness states accepted by a QMA verifier. These results suggest that simulation of quantum many-body systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad family of computational problems that has yet to be defined or characterized in terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-of-the-art classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how to improve their runtime and memory footprint.</description>

    <title>Dequantizing the Quantum Singular Value Transformation: Hardness and Applications to Quantum Chemistry and the Quantum PCP Conjecture</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09079</link>
    <author>Sevag Gharibian, François Le Gall</author>

    <description>The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result by Chia, Gilyén, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can be efficiently "dequantized" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices. We first show how to efficiently "dequantize", with arbitrarily small constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state) can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum setting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make progress on the central quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

    <description>We study the problem of generating independent samples from the output distribution of Google's Sycamore quantum circuits with a target fidelity, which is believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and has been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. We propose a new method to classically solve this problem by contracting the corresponding tensor network just once, and is massively more efficient than existing methods in obtaining a large number of uncorrelated samples with a target fidelity. For the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuit with $53$ qubits and $20$ cycles, we have generated one million uncorrelated bitstrings $\{\mathbf s\}$ which are sampled from a distribution $\widehat P(\mathbf s)=|\widehat \psi(\mathbf s)|^2$, where the approximate state $\widehat \psi$ has fidelity $F\approx 0.0037$. The whole computation has cost about $15$ hours on a computational cluster with $512$ GPUs. The obtained one million samples, the contraction code and contraction order are made public. If our algorithm could be implemented with high efficiency on a modern supercomputer with ExaFLOPS performance, we estimate that ideally, the simulation would cost a few dozens of seconds, which is faster than Google's quantum hardware.</description>

    <title>An area law for 2D frustration-free spin systems</title>

    <author>Anurag Anshu, Itai Arad, David Gosset</author>
    <pubDate>Mar 04 2021</pubDate>
    <description>We prove that the entanglement entropy of the ground state of a locally gapped frustration-free 2D lattice spin system satisfies an area law with respect to a vertical bipartition of the lattice into left and right regions. We first establish that the ground state projector of any locally gapped frustration-free 1D spin system can be approximated to within error $\epsilon$ by a degree $O(\sqrt{n\log(\epsilon^{-1})})$ multivariate polynomial in the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. This generalizes the optimal bound on the approximate degree of the boolean AND function, which corresponds to the special case of commuting Hamiltonian terms. For 2D spin systems we then construct an approximate ground state projector (AGSP) that employs the optimal 1D approximation in the vicinity of the boundary of the bipartition of interest. This AGSP has sufficiently low entanglement and error to establish the area law using a known technique.</description>

    <title>Averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling</title>

    <author>Steven T. Flammia</author>
    <pubDate>Aug 13 2021</pubDate>
    <description>We introduce ACES, a method for scalable noise metrology of quantum circuits that stands for Averaged Circuit Eigenvalue Sampling. It simultaneously estimates the individual error rates of all the gates in collections of quantum circuits, and can even account for space and time correlations between these gates. ACES strictly generalizes randomized benchmarking (RB), interleaved RB, simultaneous RB, and several other related techniques. However, ACES provides much more information and provably works under strictly weaker assumptions than these techniques. Finally, ACES is extremely scalable: we demonstrate with numerical simulations that it simultaneously and precisely estimates all the Pauli error rates on every gate and measurement in a 100 qubit quantum device using fewer than 20 relatively shallow Clifford circuits and an experimentally feasible number of samples. By learning the detailed gate errors for large quantum devices, ACES opens new possibilities for error mitigation, bespoke quantum error correcting codes and decoders, customized compilers, and more.</description>

    <description>While complex numbers are essential in mathematics, they are not needed to describe physical experiments, expressed in terms of probabilities, hence real numbers. Physics however aims to explain, rather than describe, experiments through theories. While most theories of physics are based on real numbers, quantum theory was the first to be formulated in terms of operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces. This has puzzled countless physicists, including the fathers of the theory, for whom a real version of quantum theory, in terms of real operators, seemed much more natural. In fact, previous works showed that such "real quantum theory" can reproduce the outcomes of any multipartite experiment, as long as the parts share arbitrary real quantum states. Thus, are complex numbers really needed in the quantum formalism? Here, we show this to be case by proving that real and complex quantum theory make different predictions in network scenarios comprising independent states and measurements. This allows us to devise a Bell-like experiment whose successful realization would disprove real quantum theory, in the same way as standard Bell experiments disproved local physics.</description>

    <title>How to simulate quantum measurement without computing marginals</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08499</link>
    <author>Sergey Bravyi, David Gosset, Yinchen Liu</author>
    <pubDate>Dec 17 2021</pubDate>
    <description>We describe and analyze algorithms for classically simulating measurement of an $n$-qubit quantum state $\psi$ in the standard basis, that is, sampling a bit string $x$ from the probability distribution $|\langle x|\psi\rangle|^2$. Our algorithms reduce the sampling task to computing poly$(n)$ amplitudes of $n$-qubit states; unlike previously known techniques they do not require computation of marginal probabilities. First we consider the case where $|\psi\rangle=U|0^n\rangle$ is the output state of an $m$-gate quantum circuit $U$. We propose an exact sampling algorithm which involves computing $O(m)$ amplitudes of $n$-qubit states generated by subcircuits of $U$ spanned by the first $t=1,2,\ldots,m$ gates. We show that our algorithm can significantly accelerate quantum circuit simulations based on tensor network contraction methods or low-rank stabilizer decompositions. As another striking consequence we obtain an efficient classical simulation algorithm for measurement-based quantum computation with the surface code resource state on any planar graph, generalizing a previous algorithm which was known to be efficient only under restrictive topological constraints on the ordering of single-qubit measurements. Second, we consider the case in which $\psi$ is the unique ground state of a local Hamiltonian with a spectral gap that is lower bounded by an inverse polynomial function of $n$. We prove that a simple Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain mixes rapidly to the desired probability distribution provided that $\psi$ obeys a certain technical condition, which we show is satisfied for all sign-problem free Hamiltonians. This gives a sampling algorithm which involves computing $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ amplitudes of $\psi$.</description>

    <description>We present a quantum error correcting code with dynamically generated logical qubits. When viewed as a subsystem code, the code has no logical qubits. Nevertheless, our measurement patterns generate logical qubits, allowing the code to act as a fault-tolerant quantum memory. Our particular code gives a model very similar to the two-dimensional toric code, but each measurement is a two-qubit Pauli measurement.</description>

    <description>Quantum error correction is an indispensable ingredient for scalable quantum computing. In this Perspective we discuss a particular class of quantum codes called low-density parity-check (LDPC) quantum codes. The codes we discuss are alternatives to the surface code, which is the currently leading candidate to implement quantum fault-tolerance. We introduce the zoo of LDPC quantum codes and discuss their potential for making quantum computers robust against noise. In particular, we explain recent advances in the theory of LDPC quantum codes related to certain product constructions and discuss open problems in the field.</description>

    <description>We present two classical algorithms for the simulation of universal quantum circuits on $n$ qubits constructed from $c$ instances of Clifford gates and $t$ arbitrary-angle $Z$-rotation gates such as $T$ gates. Our algorithms complement each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The $\tt{Estimate}$ algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (which scales like $\approx 1.17^t$ for $T$ gates). Our algorithm is state-of-the-art for this task: as an example, in approximately $13$ hours (on a standard desktop computer), we estimated the Born rule probability to within an additive error of $0.03$, for a $50$ qubit, $60$ non-Clifford gate quantum circuit with more than $2000$ Clifford gates. Our second algorithm, $\tt{Compute}$, calculates the probability of a chosen measurement outcome to machine precision with run-time $O(2^{t-r} t)$ where $r$ is an efficiently computable, circuit-specific quantity. With high probability, $r$ is very close to $\min \{t,n-w\}$ for random circuits with many Clifford gates, where $w$ is the number of measured qubits. $\tt{Compute}$ can be effective in surprisingly challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+$T$ circuits with $n=55$, $w=5$, $c=10^5$ and $t=80$ $T$ gates, and then compute the Born rule probability with a run-time consistently less than $10$ minutes using a single core of a standard desktop computer. We provide a C+Python implementation of our algorithms.</description>

    <description>The Eastin-Knill theorem states that no quantum error correcting code can have a universal set of transversal gates. For CSS codes that can implement Clifford gates transversally it suffices to provide one additional non-Clifford gate, such as the T-gate, to achieve universality. Common methods to implement fault-tolerant T-gates like magic state distillation generate a significant hardware overhead that will likely prevent their practical usage in the near-term future. Recently methods have been developed to mitigate the effect of noise in shallow quantum circuits that are not protected by error correction. Error mitigation methods require no additional hardware resources but suffer from a bad asymptotic scaling and apply only to a restricted class of quantum algorithms. In this work, we combine both approaches and show how to implement encoded Clifford+T circuits where Clifford gates are protected from noise by error correction while errors introduced by noisy encoded T-gates are mitigated using the quasi-probability method. As a result, Clifford+T circuits with a number of T-gates inversely proportional to the physical noise rate can be implemented on small error-corrected devices without magic state distillation. We argue that such circuits can be out of reach for state-of-the-art classical simulation algorithms.</description>

    <title>Improved upper bounds on the stabilizer rank of magic states</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07740</link>

    <pubDate>Jun 16 2021</pubDate>
    <description>In this work we improve the runtime of recent classical algorithms for strong simulation of quantum circuits composed of Clifford and T gates. The improvement is obtained by establishing a new upper bound on the stabilizer rank of $m$ copies of the magic state $|T\rangle=\sqrt{2}^{-1}(|0\rangle+e^{i\pi/4}|1\rangle)$ in the limit of large $m$. In particular, we show that $|T\rangle^{\otimes m}$ can be exactly expressed as a superposition of at most $O(2^{\alpha m})$ stabilizer states, where $\alpha\leq 0.3963$, improving on the best previously known bound $\alpha \leq 0.463$. This furnishes, via known techniques, a classical algorithm which approximates output probabilities of an $n$-qubit Clifford + T circuit $U$ with $m$ uses of the T gate to within a given inverse polynomial relative error using a runtime $\mathrm{poly}(n,m)2^{\alpha m}$. We also provide improved upper bounds on the stabilizer rank of symmetric product states $|\psi\rangle^{\otimes m}$ more generally; as a consequence we obtain a strong simulation algorithm for circuits consisting of Clifford gates and $m$ instances of any (fixed) single-qubit $Z$-rotation gate with runtime $\text{poly}(n,m) 2^{m/2}$. We suggest a method to further improve the upper bounds by constructing linear codes with certain properties.</description>

    <title>Holographic tensor network models and quantum error correction: A topical review</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02619</link>
    <author>Alexander Jahn, Jens Eisert</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 05 2021</pubDate>
    <description>Recent progress in studies of holographic dualities, originally motivated by insights from string theory, has led to a confluence with concepts and techniques from quantum information theory. A particularly successful approach has involved capturing holographic properties by means of tensor networks which not only give rise to physically meaningful correlations of holographic boundary states, but also reproduce and refine features of quantum error correction in holography. This topical review provides an overview over recent successful realizations of such models. It does so by building on an introduction of the theoretical foundations of AdS/CFT and necessary quantum information concepts, many of which have themselves developed into independent, rapidly evolving research fields.</description>

    <description>It has been shown that the apparent advantage of some quantum machine learning algorithms may be efficiently replicated using classical algorithms with suitable data access -- a process known as dequantization. Existing works on dequantization compare quantum algorithms which take copies of an n-qubit quantum state $|x\rangle = \sum_{i} x_i |i\rangle$ as input to classical algorithms which have sample and query (SQ) access to the vector $x$. In this note, we prove that classical algorithms with SQ access can accomplish some learning tasks exponentially faster than quantum algorithms with quantum state inputs. Because classical algorithms are a subset of quantum algorithms, this demonstrates that SQ access can sometimes be significantly more powerful than quantum state inputs. Our findings suggest that the absence of exponential quantum advantage in some learning tasks may be due to SQ access being too powerful relative to quantum state inputs. If we compare quantum algorithms with quantum state inputs to classical algorithms with access to measurement data on quantum states, the landscape of quantum advantage can be dramatically different. We remark that when the quantum states are constructed from exponential-size classical data, comparing SQ access and quantum state inputs is appropriate since both require exponential time to prepare.</description>

    <title>Efficient Universal Quantum Compilation: An Inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm</title>

    <description>The Solovay-Kitaev algorithm is a fundamental result in quantum computation. It gives an algorithm for efficiently compiling arbitrary unitaries using universal gate sets: any unitary can be approximated by short gates sequences, whose length scales merely poly-logarithmically with accuracy. As a consequence, the choice of gate set is typically unimportant in quantum computing. However, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm requires the gate set to be inverse-closed. It has been a longstanding open question if efficient algorithmic compilation is possible without this condition. In this work, we provide the first inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, which makes no assumption on the structure within a gate set beyond universality, answering this problem in the affirmative, and providing an efficient compilation algorithm in the absence of inverses for both $\text{SU}(d)$ and $\text{SL}(d, \mathbb{C})$. The algorithm works by showing that approximate gate implementations of the generalized Pauli group can self-correct their errors.</description>

    <description>Quantum computers can be protected from noise by encoding the logical quantum information redundantly into multiple qubits using error correcting codes. When manipulating the logical quantum states, it is imperative that errors caused by imperfect operations do not spread uncontrollably through the quantum register. This requires that all operations on the quantum register obey a fault-tolerant circuit design which, in general, increases the complexity of the implementation. Here, we demonstrate a fault-tolerant universal set of gates on two logical qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we make use of the recently introduced paradigm of flag fault tolerance, where the absence or presence of dangerous errors is heralded by usage of few ancillary 'flag' qubits. We perform a logical two-qubit CNOT-gate between two instances of the seven qubit color code, and we also fault-tolerantly prepare a logical magic state. We then realize a fault-tolerant logical T-gate by injecting the magic state via teleportation from one logical qubit onto the other. We observe the hallmark feature of fault tolerance, a superior performance compared to a non-fault-tolerant implementation. In combination with recently demonstrated repeated quantum error correction cycles these results open the door to error-corrected universal quantum computation.</description>

    <description>Scaling up to a large number of qubits with high-precision control is essential in the demonstrations of quantum computational advantage to exponentially outpace the classical hardware and algorithmic improvements. Here, we develop a two-dimensional programmable superconducting quantum processor, \textitZuchongzhi, which is composed of 66 functional qubits in a tunable coupling architecture. To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature \textbf574, 505 (2019)]. We estimate that the sampling task finished by \textitZuchongzhi in about 1.2 hours will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 years. Our work establishes an unambiguous quantum computational advantage that is infeasible for classical computation in a reasonable amount of time. The high-precision and programmable quantum computing platform opens a new door to explore novel many-body phenomena and implement complex quantum algorithms.</description>

    <description>Realizing the potential of quantum computing will require achieving sufficiently low logical error rates. Many applications call for error rates in the $10^{-15}$ regime, but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near $10^{-3}$. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits so that errors can be detected and corrected. Logical errors are then exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold. QEC also requires that the errors are local and that performance is maintained over many rounds of error correction, two major outstanding experimental challenges. Here, we implement 1D repetition codes embedded in a 2D grid of superconducting qubits which demonstrate exponential suppression of bit or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round by more than $100\times$ when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analyzing error correlations with high precision, and characterize the locality of errors in a device performing QEC for the first time. Finally, we perform error detection using a small 2D surface code logical qubit on the same device, and show that the results from both 1D and 2D codes agree with numerical simulations using a simple depolarizing error model. These findings demonstrate that superconducting qubits are on a viable path towards fault tolerant quantum computing.</description>

    <title>A randomized quantum algorithm for statistical phase estimation</title>

    <description>Phase estimation is a quantum algorithm for measuring the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. We propose and rigorously analyse a randomized phase estimation algorithm with two distinctive features. First, our algorithm has complexity independent of the number of terms L in the Hamiltonian. Second, unlike previous L-independent approaches, such as those based on qDRIFT, all sources of error in our algorithm can be suppressed by collecting more data samples, without increasing the circuit depth.</description>

    <title>General tensor network decoding of 2D Pauli codes</title>

    <description>In this work we develop a general tensor network decoder for 2D codes. Specifically, we propose a decoder that approximates maximally likelihood decoding for 2D stabiliser and subsystem codes subject to Pauli noise. For a code consisting of $n$ qubits our decoder has a runtime of $O(n\log n+n\chi^3)$, where $\chi$ is an approximation parameter. We numerically demonstrate the power of this decoder by studying four classes of codes under three noise models, namely regular surface codes, irregular surface codes, subsystem surface codes and colour codes, under bit-flip, phase-flip and depolarising noise. We show that the thresholds yielded by our decoder are state-of-the-art, and numerically consistent with optimal thresholds where available, suggesting that the tensor network decoder well approximates optimal decoding in all these cases. Novel to our decoder is an efficient and effective approximate contraction scheme for arbitrary 2D tensor networks, which may be of independent interest. We have also released an implementation of this algorithm as a stand-alone Julia package: SweepContractor.jl.</description>

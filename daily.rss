    <title>Stability Experiments: The Overlooked Dual of Memory Experiments</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13834</link>

    <description>Topological quantum computations are built on a foundation of two basic tasks: preserving logical observables through time and moving logical observables through space. Memory experiments, which check how well logical observables are preserved through time, are a well established benchmark. Strangely, there is no corresponding well established benchmark for moving logical observables through space. This paper tries to fill that gap with "stability experiments", which check how well a quantum error correction system can determine the product of a large region of stabilizers. Stability experiments achieve this by testing on a region that is locally a normal code but globally has a known product of stabilizers.</description>

    <title>Quantum Dictionaries without QRAM</title>

    <description>This paper presents an efficient gate-level implementation of a quantum dictionary: a data structure that can store a superposition of mappings from keys to values. The dictionary is stored as a fixed-length list of sorted address-value pairs, where the length of the list is the maximum number of entries that can be put in the dictionary. An addressed value can be extracted from (or injected into) the dictionary using $C \cdot (V + 2.5A) + O(V + A + C)$ expected Toffoli gates and $O(V + A)$ auxiliary qubits (where $C$ is the maximum capacity, $A$ is the address width, and $V$ is the value width).</description>

    <title>Symbolic synthesis of Clifford circuits and beyond</title>

    <description>Path sums are a convenient symbolic formalism for quantum operations with applications to the simulation, optimization, and verification of quantum protocols. Unlike quantum circuits, path sums are not limited to unitary operations, but can express arbitrary linear ones. Two problems, therefore, naturally arise in the study of path sums: the unitarity problem and the extraction problem. The former is the problem of deciding whether a given path sum represents a unitary operator. The latter is the problem of constructing a quantum circuit, given a path sum promised to represent a unitary operator. We show that the unitarity problem is co-NP-hard in general, but that it is in P when restricted to Clifford path sums. We then provide an algorithm to synthesize a Clifford circuit from a unitary Clifford path sum. The circuits produced by our extraction algorithm are of the form $C_1HC_2$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are Hadamard-free circuits and $H$ is a layer of Hadamard gates. We also provide a heuristic generalization of our extraction algorithm to arbitrary path sums. While this algorithm is not guaranteed to succeed, it often succeeds and typically produces natural looking circuits. Alongside applications to the optimization and decompilation of quantum circuits, we demonstrate the capability of our algorithm by synthesizing the standard quantum Fourier transform directly from a path sum.</description>

    <title>Emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry in the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma chain with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13810</link>

    <description>We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma model with a bond-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which can be induced by an electric field applied in the third direction where the first and second directions refer to the two bond directions in the model. By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain. The analytic predictions are in good agreements with numerical results obtained from density matrix renormalization group simulations.</description>

    <title>Symmetric Mass Generation</title>

    <description>The most well-known mechanism for fermions to acquire a mass is the Nambu-Goldstone-Anderson-Higgs mechanism, i.e. after a spontaneous symmetry breaking, a bosonic field that couples to the fermion mass term condenses, which grants a mass gap for the fermionic excitation. In the last few years, it was gradually understood that there is a new mechanism of mass generation for fermions without involving any symmetry breaking within an anomaly-free symmetry group. This new mechanism is generally referred to as the "Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG)." It is realized that the SMG has deep connections with interacting topological insulator/superconductors, symmetry-protected topological states, perturbative local and non-perturbative global anomaly cancellations, and deconfined quantum criticality. It has strong implications for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories. This article defines the SMG, summarizes current numerical results, introduces a novel unifying theoretical framework (including the parton-Higgs and the s-confinement mechanisms, as well as the symmetry-extension construction), and overviews various features and applications of SMG.</description>

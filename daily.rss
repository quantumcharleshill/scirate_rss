    <description>Magic states are the resource that allows quantum computers to attain an advantage over classical computers. This resource consists in the deviation from a property called stabilizerness which in turn implies that stabilizer circuits can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Without magic, no quantum computer can do anything that a classical computer cannot do. Given the importance of magic for quantum computation, it would be useful to have a method for measuring the amount of magic in a quantum state. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a protocol for measuring magic based on randomized measurements. Our experiments are carried out on two IBM Quantum Falcon processors. This protocol can provide a characterization of the effectiveness of a quantum hardware in producing states that cannot be effectively simulated on a classical computer. We show how from these measurements one can construct realistic noise models affecting the hardware.</description>

    <title>Constructing all qutrit controlled Clifford+T gates in Clifford+T</title>

    <description>For a number of useful quantum circuits, qudit constructions have been found which reduce resource requirements compared to the best known or best possible qubit construction. However, many of the necessary qutrit gates in these constructions have never been explicitly and efficiently constructed in a fault-tolerant manner. We show how to exactly and unitarily construct any qutrit multiple-controlled Clifford+T unitary using just Clifford+T gates and without using ancillae. The T-count to do so is polynomial in the number of controls $k$, scaling as $O(k^{3.585})$. With our results we can construct ancilla-free Clifford+T implementations of multiple-controlled T gates as well as all versions of the qutrit multiple-controlled Toffoli, while the analogous results for qubits are impossible. As an application of our results, we provide a procedure to implement any ternary classical reversible function on $n$ trits as an ancilla-free qutrit unitary using $O(3^n n^{3.585})$ T gates.</description>

    <title>Bi-PPT channels are entanglement breaking</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01685</link>

    <description>In a recent paper, Hirche and Leditzky introduced the notion of bi-PPT channels which are quantum channels that stay completely positive under composition with a transposition and such that the same property holds for one of their complementary channels. They asked whether there are examples of such channels that are not antidegradable. We show that this is not the case, since bi-PPT channels are always entanglement breaking. We also show that degradable quantum channels staying completely positive under composition with a transposition are entanglement breaking.</description>

    <title>Perceval: A Software Platform for Discrete Variable Photonic Quantum Computing</title>

    <description>We introduce Perceval, an evolutive open-source software platform for simulating and interfacing with discrete variable photonic quantum computers, and describe its main features and components. Its Python front-end allows photonic circuits to be composed from basic photonic building blocks like photon sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors. A variety of computational back-ends are available and optimised for different use-cases. These use state-of-the-art simulation techniques covering both weak simulation, or sampling, and strong simulation. We give examples of Perceval in action by reproducing a variety of photonic experiments and simulating photonic implementations of a range of quantum algorithms, from Grover's and Shor's to examples of quantum machine learning. Perceval is intended to be a useful toolkit both for experimentalists wishing to easily model, design, simulate, or optimise a discrete variable photonic experiment, and for theoreticians wishing to design algorithms and applications for discrete-variable photonic quantum computing platforms.</description>

    <title>Inverse-design of high-dimensional quantum optical circuits in a complex medium</title>

    <description>Programmable optical circuits form a key part of quantum technologies today, ranging from transceivers for quantum communication to integrated photonic chips for quantum information processing. As the size of such circuits is increased, maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging, leading to a reduction in the quality of the operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we show how embedding an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability over the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear optical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial multi-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these circuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show how their programmability allows us to turn the multi-mode fibre itself into a generalised multi-outcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. Finally, we discuss the scalability of our approach, numerically showing how a high circuit fidelity can be achieved with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode-mixer. Our work serves as an alternative yet powerful approach for realising precise control over high-dimensional quantum states of light, with clear applications in next-generation quantum communication and computing technologies.</description>

    <description>The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code encodes a qubit into a bosonic mode using periodic wavefunctions. This periodicity makes the GKP code a natural setting for the Zak transform, which is tailor-made to provide a simple description for periodic functions. We review the Zak transform and its connection to a Zak basis of states in Hilbert space, decompose the shift operators that underpin the stabilizers and the correctable errors, and we find that Zak transforms of the position wavefunction appear naturally in GKP error correction. We construct a new bosonic subsystem decomposition (SSD) -- the modular variable SSD -- by dividing a mode's Hilbert space, expressed in the Zak basis, into that of a virtual qubit and a virtual gauge mode. Tracing over the gauge mode gives a logical-qubit state, and preceding the trace with a particular logical-gauge interaction gives a different logical state -- that associated to GKP error correction.</description>

    <description>Despite the great promise of quantum machine learning models, there are several challenges one must overcome before unlocking their full potential. For instance, models based on quantum neural networks (QNNs) can suffer from excessive local minima and barren plateaus in their training landscapes. Recently, the nascent field of geometric quantum machine learning (GQML) has emerged as a potential solution to some of those issues. The key insight of GQML is that one should design architectures, such as equivariant QNNs, encoding the symmetries of the problem at hand. Here, we focus on problems with permutation symmetry (i.e., the group of symmetry $S_n$), and show how to build $S_n$-equivariant QNNs. We provide an analytical study of their performance, proving that they do not suffer from barren plateaus, quickly reach overparametrization, and can generalize well from small amounts of data. To verify our results, we perform numerical simulations for a graph state classification task. Our work provides the first theoretical guarantees for equivariant QNNs, thus indicating the extreme power and potential of GQML.</description>

    <description>Indistinguishability of particles is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date - including fermions, bosons, and Abelian anyons - this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged. However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions. Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals, their experimental observation has remained elusive for decades. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we prepare the ground state of the surface code and manipulate it via unitary operations to form wavefunctions that are described by non-Abelian anyons. By implementing a unitary protocol to move the anyons, we experimentally verify the fusion rules of non-Abelian Ising anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. Building on our technique, we study the prospect of employing the anyons for quantum computation and utilize braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work represents a key step towards topological quantum computing.</description>

    <title>The Gauge Picture of Quantum Dynamics</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09314</link>

    <description>Although local Hamiltonians exhibit local time dynamics, this locality is not explicit in the Schrödinger picture in the sense that the wavefunction amplitudes do not obey a local equation of motion. In this work, we modify the Schrödinger picture such that geometric locality is explicit. To do this, we replace the wavefunction with a collection of local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$, one for each patch of space $J$. The collection of spatial patches is chosen to cover the space; e.g. we could choose the patches to be nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice. The Hilbert spaces associated with neighboring pairs of spatial patches $I$ and $J$ are related to each other by dynamical unitary transformations $U_{IJ}$. The equations of motion for the local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$ and connections $U_{IJ}$ are explicitly local in space. We call this picture of quantum dynamics the gauge picture since it exhibits a local gauge symmetry. The local dynamics of a single spatial patch is related to the interaction picture, where the interaction Hamiltonian consists of only nearby Hamiltonian terms. We can also generalize the explicit locality to include locality in local charge and energy densities.</description>

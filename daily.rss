    <description>Parameterized complexity theory was developed in the 1990s to enrich the complexity-theoretic analysis of problems that depend on a range of parameters. In this paper we establish a quantum equivalent of classical parameterized complexity theory, motivated by the need for new tools for the classifications of the complexity of real-world problems. We introduce the quantum analogues of a range of parameterized complexity classes and examine the relationship between these classes, their classical counterparts, and well-studied problems. This framework exposes a rich classification of the complexity of parameterized versions of QMA-hard problems, demonstrating, for example, a clear separation between the Quantum Circuit Satisfiability problem and the Local Hamiltonian problem.</description>

    <description>With today's quantum processors venturing into regimes beyond the capabilities of classical devices [1-3], we face the challenge to verify that these devices perform as intended, even when we cannot check their results on classical computers [4,5]. In a recent breakthrough in computer science [6-8], a protocol was developed that allows the verification of the output of a computation performed by an untrusted quantum device based only on classical resources. Here, we follow these ideas, and demonstrate in a first, proof-of-principle experiment a verification protocol using only classical means on a small trapped-ion quantum processor. We contrast this to verification protocols, which require trust and detailed hardware knowledge, as in gate-level benchmarking [9], or additional quantum resources in case we do not have access to or trust in the device to be tested [5]. While our experimental demonstration uses a simplified version [10] of Mahadev's protocol [6] we demonstrate the necessary steps for verifying fully untrusted devices. A scaled-up version of our protocol will allow for classical verification, requiring no hardware access or detailed knowledge of the tested device. Its security relies on post-quantum secure trapdoor functions within an interactive proof [11]. The conceptually straightforward, but technologically challenging scaled-up version of the interactive proofs, considered here, can be used for a variety of additional tasks such as verifying quantum advantage [8], generating [12] and certifying quantum randomness [7], or composable remote state preparation [13].</description>

    <title>Locality optimization for parent Hamiltonians of Tensor Networks</title>

    <description>Tensor Network states form a powerful framework for both the analytical and numerical study of strongly correlated phases. Vital to their analytical utility is that they appear as the exact ground states of associated parent Hamiltonians, where canonical proof techniques guarantee a controlled ground space structure. Yet, while those Hamiltonians are local by construction, the known techniques often yield complex Hamiltonians which act on a rather large number of spins. In this paper, we present an algorithm to systematically simplify parent Hamiltonians, breaking them down into any given basis of elementary interaction terms. The underlying optimization problem is a semidefinite program, and thus the optimal solution can be found efficiently. Our method exploits a degree of freedom in the construction of parent Hamiltonians -- the excitation spectrum of the local terms -- over which it optimizes such as to obtain the best possible approximation. We benchmark our method on the AKLT model and the Toric Code model, where we show that the canonical parent Hamiltonians (acting on 3 or 4 and 12 sites, respectively) can be broken down to the known optimal 2-body and 4-body terms. We then apply our method to the paradigmatic Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) model on the kagome lattice. Here, the simplest previously known parent Hamiltonian acts on all the 12 spins on one kagome star. With our optimization algorithm, we obtain a vastly simpler Hamiltonian: We find that the RVB model is the exact ground state of a parent Hamiltonian whose terms are all products of at most four Heisenberg interactions, and whose range can be further constrained, providing a major improvement over the previously known 12-body Hamiltonian.</description>

    <title>Algorithmic cooling for resolving state preparation and measurement errors in quantum computing</title>

    <description>State preparation and measurement errors are commonly regarded as indistinguishable. The problem of distinguishing state preparation (SPAM) errors from measurement errors is important to the field of characterizing quantum processors. In this work, we propose a method to separately characterize SPAM errors using a novel type of algorithmic cooling protocol called measurement-based algorithmic cooling (MBAC). MBAC assumes the ability to perform (potentially imperfect) projective measurements on individual qubits, which is available on many modern quantum processors. We demonstrate that MBAC can significantly reduce state preparation error under realistic assumptions, with a small overhead that can be upper bounded by measurable quantities. Thus, MBAC can be a valuable tool not only for benchmarking near-term quantum processors, but also for improving the performance of quantum processors in an algorithmic manner.</description>

    <title>Entanglement is more than transitive</title>

    <description>One of the goals of science is to understand the relation between a whole and its parts, as exemplified by the problem of certifying the entanglement of a system from the knowledge of its reduced states. Here, we focus on a different but related question: can a collection of marginal information reveal new marginal information? We answer this affirmatively, and show that (non-) entangled marginal states may exhibit (meta)transitivity of entanglement, i.e., imply that a different target marginal must be entangled. By showing that the global $n$-qubit state compatible with certain two-qubit marginals in a tree form is unique, we prove that transitivity exists for a system involving an arbitrarily large number of qubits. We also completely characterize when (meta)transitivity can occur in a tripartite scenario when the two-qudit marginals given are either the Werner states or the isotropic states. Our numerical results suggest that in the tripartite scenario, entanglement transitivity is generic among the marginals derived from pure states.</description>

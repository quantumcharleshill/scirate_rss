    <description>Fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computation is commonly acknowledged to be crucial to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms that could lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected framework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no matter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these gates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three protocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations such as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates: Transversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical states of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states, including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results hint at high quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further research on this technique.</description>

    <description>Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing. In this paper, we study the magic of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) by the $L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm. We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the $1$D RMPS is highly magical. Our numerical results confirm that the magic grows exponentially in the qubit case.</description>

    <title>What aspects of the phenomenology of interference witness nonclassicality?</title>

    <description>Interference phenomena are often claimed to resist classical explanation. However, such claims are undermined by the fact that the specific aspects of the phenomenology upon which they are based can in fact be reproduced in a noncontextual ontological model [Catani et al. arXiv:2111.13727]. This raises the question of what other aspects of the phenomenology of interference do in fact resist classical explanation. We answer this question by demonstrating that the most basic quantum wave-particle duality relation, which expresses the precise trade-off between path distinguishability and fringe visibility, cannot be reproduced in any noncontextual model. We do this by showing that it is a specific type of uncertainty relation, and then leveraging a recent result establishing that noncontextuality restricts the functional form of this uncertainty relation [Catani et al. arXiv:2207.11779]. Finally, we discuss what sorts of interferometric experiment can demonstrate contextuality via the wave-particle duality relation.</description>

    <title>Private Federated Statistics in an Interactive Setting</title>

    <description>Privately learning statistics of events on devices can enable improved user experience. Differentially private algorithms for such problems can benefit significantly from interactivity. We argue that an aggregation protocol can enable an interactive private federated statistics system where user's devices maintain control of the privacy assurance. We describe the architecture of such a system, and analyze its security properties.</description>

    <title>Optimal Algorithms for Linear Algebra in the Current Matrix Multiplication Time</title>

    <description>We study fundamental problems in linear algebra, such as finding a maximal linearly independent subset of rows or columns (a basis), solving linear regression, or computing a subspace embedding. For these problems, we consider input matrices $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ with $n > d$. The input can be read in $\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A})$ time, which denotes the number of nonzero entries of $\mathbf{A}$. In this paper, we show that beyond the time required to read the input matrix, these fundamental linear algebra problems can be solved in $d^{\omega}$ time, i.e., where $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the current matrix-multiplication exponent. To do so, we introduce a constant-factor subspace embedding with the optimal $m=\mathcal{O}(d)$ number of rows, and which can be applied in time $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A})}{\alpha}\right) + d^{2 + \alpha}\text{poly}(\log d)$ for any trade-off parameter $\alpha>0$, tightening a recent result by Chepurko et. al. [SODA 2022] that achieves an $\exp(\text{poly}(\log\log n))$ distortion with $m=d\cdot\text{poly}(\log\log d)$ rows in $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A})}{\alpha}+d^{2+\alpha+o(1)}\right)$ time. Our subspace embedding uses a recently shown property of stacked Subsampled Randomized Hadamard Transforms (SRHT), which actually increase the input dimension, to "spread" the mass of an input vector among a large number of coordinates, followed by random sampling. To control the effects of random sampling, we use fast semidefinite programming to reweight the rows. We then use our constant-factor subspace embedding to give the first optimal runtime algorithms for finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns, regression, and leverage score sampling. To do so, we also introduce a novel subroutine that iteratively grows a set of independent rows, which may be of independent interest.</description>

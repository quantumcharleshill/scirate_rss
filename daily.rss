    <title>Optimizing thermalizations</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12616</link>
    <author>Kamil Korzekwa, Matteo Lostaglio</author>

    <description>We present a rigorous approach, based on the concept of continuous thermomajorisation, to algorithmically characterise the full set of energy occupations of a quantum system accessible from a given initial state through weak interactions with a heat bath. The algorithm can be deployed to solve complex optimization problems in out-of-equilibrium setups and it returns explicit elementary control sequences realizing optimal transformations. We illustrate this by finding optimal protocols in the context of cooling, work extraction and catalysis. The same tools also allow one to quantitatively assess the role played by memory effects in the performance of thermodynamic protocols. We obtained exhaustive solutions on a laptop machine for systems with dimension $d\leq 7$, but with heuristic methods one could access much higher $d$.</description>

    <title>One-dimensional SPT phases protected by frieze symmetries</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12880</link>
    <author>Bram Vancraeynest-De Cuiper, Nicolas Dewolf, Jutho Haegeman, Frank Verstraete</author>

    <description>We undertake a systematic study of symmetry-protected topological gapped phases of quantum spin chains in the presence of the quasi-one-dimensional frieze space groups. Here, the spatial symmetries of the one-dimensional lattice are considered together with an additional 'vertical reflection', which we take to be an on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. We identify seventeen distinct non-trivial phases and define canonical forms. If time-reversal is combined with a shift over one site, then no new topological phases arise. We furthermore construct explicit renormalization-group fixed point wavefunctions for symmetry-protected topological phases with global on-site symmetries, and demonstrate how group cohomology can be computed using the Smith normal form</description>

    <title>Physics solutions for machine learning privacy leaks</title>

    <description>Machine learning systems are becoming more and more ubiquitous in increasingly complex areas, including cutting-edge scientific research. The opposite is also true: the interest in better understanding the inner workings of machine learning systems motivates their analysis under the lens of different scientific disciplines. Physics is particularly successful in this, due to its ability to describe complex dynamical systems. While explanations of phenomena in machine learning based on physics are increasingly present, examples of direct application of notions akin to physics in order to improve machine learning systems are more scarce. Here we provide one such application in the problem of developing algorithms that preserve the privacy of the manipulated data, which is especially important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. We develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to specific types of privacy leaks, and rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. These are inspired by the efficient representation of quantum many-body systems, and have shown to compete and even surpass traditional machine learning architectures in certain cases. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

    <title>Relation between Quantum Coherence and Quantum Entanglement in Quantum Measurements</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12656</link>
    <author>Ho-Joon Kim, Soojoon Lee</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 28 2022</pubDate>
    <description>Quantum measurement is a class of quantum channels that sends quantum states to classical states. We set up resource theories of quantum coherence and quantum entanglement for quantum measurements and find relations between them. For this, we conceive a relative entropy type quantity to account for the quantum resources of quantum measurements. The quantum coherence of a quantum measurement can be converted into the entanglement in a bipartite quantum measurement through coherence-non generating transformations. Conversely, a quantum entanglement monotone of quantum measurements induces a quantum coherence monotone of quantum measurement. Our results confirm that the intuition on the link between quantum coherence and quantum entanglement is valid even for quantum measurements which do not generate any quantum resource.</description>

    <title>On distinguishability distillation and dilution exponents</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12433</link>
    <author>Mark M. Wilde</author>
    <pubDate>Feb 28 2022</pubDate>
    <description>In this note, I define error exponents and strong converse exponents for the tasks of distinguishability distillation and dilution. These are counterparts to the one-shot distillable distinguishability and the one-shot distinguishability cost, as previously defined in the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability. I show that they can be evaluated by semi-definite programming, establish a number of their properties, bound them using Rényi relative entropies, and relate them to each other.</description>

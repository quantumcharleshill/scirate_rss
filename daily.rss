    <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy random circuit sampling</title>

    <description>We give a polynomial time classical algorithm for sampling from the output distribution of a noisy random quantum circuit in the regime of anti-concentration to within inverse polynomial total variation distance. This gives strong evidence that, in the presence of a constant rate of noise per gate, random circuit sampling (RCS) cannot be the basis of a scalable experimental violation of the extended Church-Turing thesis. Our algorithm is not practical in its current form, and does not address finite-size RCS based quantum supremacy experiments.</description>

    <description>We construct Pauli topological subsystem codes characterized by arbitrary two-dimensional Abelian anyon theories--this includes anyon theories with degenerate braiding relations and those without a gapped boundary to the vacuum. Our work both extends the classification of two-dimensional Pauli topological subsystem codes to systems of composite-dimensional qudits and establishes that the classification is at least as rich as that of Abelian anyon theories. We exemplify the construction with topological subsystem codes defined on four-dimensional qudits based on the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{(1)}$ anyon theory with degenerate braiding relations and the chiral semion theory--both of which cannot be captured by topological stabilizer codes. The construction proceeds by "gauging out" certain anyon types of a topological stabilizer code. This amounts to defining a gauge group generated by the stabilizer group of the topological stabilizer code and a set of anyonic string operators for the anyon types that are gauged out. The resulting topological subsystem code is characterized by an anyon theory containing a proper subset of the anyons of the topological stabilizer code. We thereby show that every Abelian anyon theory is a subtheory of a stack of toric codes and a certain family of twisted quantum doubles that generalize the double semion anyon theory. We further prove a number of general statements about the logical operators of translation invariant topological subsystem codes and define their associated anyon theories in terms of higher-form symmetries.</description>

    <title>On the amortized complexity of approximate counting</title>

    <description>Naively storing a counter up to value $n$ would require $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of memory. Nelson and Yu [NY22], following work of [Morris78], showed that if the query answers need only be $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate with probability at least $1 - \delta$, then $O(\log\log n + \log\log(1/\delta) + \log(1/\epsilon))$ bits suffice, and in fact this bound is tight. Morris' original motivation for studying this problem though, as well as modern applications, require not only maintaining one counter, but rather $k$ counters for $k$ large. This motivates the following question: for $k$ large, can $k$ counters be simultaneously maintained using asymptotically less memory than $k$ times the cost of an individual counter? That is to say, does this problem benefit from an improved \it amortized space complexity bound? We answer this question in the negative. Specifically, we prove a lower bound for nearly the full range of parameters showing that, in terms of memory usage, there is no asymptotic benefit possible via amortization when storing multiple counters. Our main proof utilizes a certain notion of "information cost" recently introduced by Braverman, Garg and Woodruff in FOCS 2020 to prove lower bounds for streaming algorithms.</description>

    <title>Universal features of entanglement entropy in the honeycomb Hubbard model</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04334</link>

    <description>The entanglement entropy is a unique probe to reveal universal features of strongly interacting many-body systems. In two or more dimensions these features are subtle, and detecting them numerically requires extreme precision, a notoriously difficult task. This is especially challenging in models of interacting fermions, where many such universal features have yet to be observed. In this paper we tackle this challenge by introducing a new method to compute the RÃ©nyi entanglement entropy in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, where we treat the entangling region itself as a stochastic variable. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method by extracting, for the first time, universal subleading logarithmic terms in a two dimensional model of interacting fermions, focusing on the honeycomb Hubbard model at $T=0$. We detect the universal corner contribution due to gapless fermions throughout the Dirac semi-metal phase and at the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point, as well as the universal Goldstone mode contribution in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase.</description>

    <title>Learning quantum processes without input control</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.05005</link>

    <description>We introduce a general statistical learning theory for processes that take as input a classical random variable and output a quantum state. This is a practically motivated setting where the learner wants to find an approximate representation of an unknown quantum process, without having control on the classical inputs that govern the process itself, e.g., in learning astronomical processes, studying disordered systems and biological processes not controlled by the observer. We provide an algorithm for learning with high probability in this setting with a finite amount of samples, even if the concept class is infinite. To do this, we review and adapt existing algorithms for shadow tomography and hypothesis selection, and combine their guarantees with the uniform convergence on the data of the loss functions of interest. As a by-product we obtain sufficient conditions for performing shadow tomography of classical-quantum states with a number of copies which depend only on the dimension of the quantum register. We give concrete examples of processes that can be learned in this manner, based on quantum circuits or physically motivated scenarios like systems subject to Hamiltonians with random perturbations or data-dependent phase-shifts.</description>

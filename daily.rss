    <description>Indistinguishability of particles is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. For all elementary and quasiparticles observed to date - including fermions, bosons, and Abelian anyons - this principle guarantees that the braiding of identical particles leaves the system unchanged. However, in two spatial dimensions, an intriguing possibility exists: braiding of non-Abelian anyons causes rotations in a space of topologically degenerate wavefunctions. Hence, it can change the observables of the system without violating the principle of indistinguishability. Despite the well developed mathematical description of non-Abelian anyons and numerous theoretical proposals, their experimental observation has remained elusive for decades. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we prepare the ground state of the surface code and manipulate it via unitary operations to form wavefunctions that are described by non-Abelian anyons. By implementing a unitary protocol to move the anyons, we experimentally verify the fusion rules of non-Abelian Ising anyons and braid them to realize their statistics. Building on our technique, we study the prospect of employing the anyons for quantum computation and utilize braiding to create an entangled state of anyons encoding three logical qubits. Our work represents a key step towards topological quantum computing.</description>

    <title>Error Suppression for Arbitrary-Size Black Box Quantum Operations</title>

    <description>Efficient suppression of errors without full error correction is crucial for applications with NISQ devices. Error mitigation allows us to suppress errors in extracting expectation values without the need for any error correction code, but its applications are limited to estimating expectation values, and cannot provide us with high-fidelity quantum operations acting on arbitrary quantum states. To address this challenge, we propose to use error filtration (EF) for gate-based quantum computation, as a practical error suppression scheme without resorting to full quantum error correction. The result is a general-purpose error suppression protocol where the resources required to suppress errors scale independently of the size of the quantum operation. We further analyze the application of EF to quantum random access memory, where EF offers a hardware-efficient error suppression.</description>

    <title>Lattice-Based Quantum Advantage from Rotated Measurements</title>

    <description>Trapdoor claw-free functions (TCFs) are immensely valuable in cryptographic interactions between a classical client and a quantum server. Typically, a protocol has the quantum server prepare a superposition of two-bit strings of a claw and then measure it using Pauli-$X$ or $Z$ measurements. In this paper, we demonstrate a new technique that uses the entire range of qubit measurements from the $XY$-plane. We show the advantage of this approach in two applications. First, building on (Brakerski et al. 2018, Kalai et al. 2022), we show an optimized two-round proof of quantumness whose security can be expressed directly in terms of the hardness of the LWE (learning with errors) problem. Second, we construct a one-round protocol for blind remote preparation of an arbitrary state on the $XY$-plane up to a Pauli-$Z$ correction.</description>

    <title>Faster Matrix Multiplication via Asymmetric Hashing</title>

    <description>Fast matrix multiplication is one of the most fundamental problems in algorithm research. The exponent of the optimal time complexity of matrix multiplication is usually denoted by $\omega$. This paper discusses new ideas for improving the laser method for fast matrix multiplication. We observe that the analysis of higher powers of the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor [Coppersmith & Winograd 1990] incurs a "combination loss", and we partially compensate it by using an asymmetric version of CW's hashing method. By analyzing the 8th power of the CW tensor, we give a new bound of $\omega<2.37188$, which improves the previous best bound of $\omega<2.37286$ [Alman & V.Williams 2020]. Our result breaks the lower bound of $2.3725$ in [Ambainis et al. 2014] because of the new method for analyzing component (constituent) tensors.</description>

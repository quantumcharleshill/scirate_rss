    <title>The Physics of Quantum Information</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08064</link>

    <description>Rapid ongoing progress in quantum information science makes this an apt time for a Solvay Conference focused on The Physics of Quantum Information. Here I review four intertwined themes encompassed by this topic: Quantum computer science, quantum hardware, quantum matter, and quantum gravity. Though the time scale for broad practical impact of quantum computation is still uncertain, in the near future we can expect noteworthy progress toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing, and discoveries enabled by programmable quantum simulators. In the longer term, controlling highly complex quantum matter will open the door to profound scientific advances and powerful new technologies.</description>

    <title>A hybrid framework for estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states</title>

    <description>Estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states, such as the moment $\tr(\rho^m)$, is of fundamental and practical interest in quantum science and technology. Here we show a quantum-classical hybrid framework to measure them, where the quantum part is constituted by the generalized swap test, and the classical part is realized by postprocessing the result from randomized measurements. This hybrid framework utilizes the partial coherent power of the intermediate-scale quantum processor and, at the same time, dramatically reduces the number of quantum measurements and the cost of classical postprocessing. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework in the tasks of state-moment estimation and quantum error mitigation.</description>

    <title>The grammar of the Ising model: A new complexity hierarchy</title>

    <description>How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii) constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this theorem to show that the 1d Ising model and the Ising model on layerwise complete graphs are constructive context free, and the 2d Ising model, the all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are constructive context sensitive. We also provide a grammar for the 1d and 2d Ising model. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical interactions in terms of grammars.</description>

    <title>Reducing molecular electronic Hamiltonian simulation cost for Linear Combination of Unitaries approaches</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08272</link>

    <description>We consider different Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) decompositions for molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. Using these LCU decompositions for Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum computer, the main figure of merit is the 1-norm of their coefficients, which is associated with the quantum circuit complexity. It is derived that the lowest possible LCU 1-norm for a given Hamiltonian is half of its spectral range. This lowest norm decomposition is practically unattainable for general Hamiltonians; therefore, multiple practical techniques to generate LCU decompositions are proposed and assessed. A technique using symmetries to reduce the 1-norm further is also introduced. In addition to considering LCU in the Schr√∂dinger picture, we extend it to the interaction picture, which substantially further reduces the 1-norm.</description>

    <title>Classical shadows of fermions with particle number symmetry</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08964</link>

    <description>We consider classical shadows of fermion wavefunctions with $\eta$ particles occupying $n$ modes. We prove that of all $k$-reduced density matrices may be simultaneously estimated to an average variance of $\epsilon^{2}$ using at most $\binom{\eta}{k}\big(1-\frac{\eta-k}{n}\big)^{k}\frac{1+n}{1+n-k}/\epsilon^{2}$ measurements in random single-particle bases that conserve particle number, and provide an estimator that is computationally efficient. This is a super-exponential improvement over the $\binom{n}{k}\sqrt{\pi k}/\epsilon^{2}$ scaling of prior approaches as $n$ can be arbitrarily larger than $\eta$ in natural problems. Our method, in the worst-case of half-filling, still provides a factor of $4^{k}$ advantage in sample complexity, and also estimates all $\eta$-reduced density matrices, applicable to estimating overlaps with all single Slater determinants, with at most $\frac{4}{3}/\epsilon^{2}$ samples, which is additionally independent of $\eta$.</description>

    <title>The Physics of Quantum Information</title>

    <description>Rapid ongoing progress in quantum information science makes this an apt time for a Solvay Conference focused on The Physics of Quantum Information. Here I review four intertwined themes encompassed by this topic: Quantum computer science, quantum hardware, quantum matter, and quantum gravity. Though the time scale for broad practical impact of quantum computation is still uncertain, in the near future we can expect noteworthy progress toward scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing, and discoveries enabled by programmable quantum simulators. In the longer term, controlling highly complex quantum matter will open the door to profound scientific advances and powerful new technologies.</description>

    <title>Classical shadows of fermions with particle number symmetry</title>

    <description>We consider classical shadows of fermion wavefunctions with $\eta$ particles occupying $n$ modes. We prove that of all $k$-reduced density matrices may be simultaneously estimated to an average variance of $\epsilon^{2}$ using at most $\binom{\eta}{k}\big(1-\frac{\eta-k}{n}\big)^{k}\frac{1+n}{1+n-k}/\epsilon^{2}$ measurements in random single-particle bases that conserve particle number, and provide an estimator that is computationally efficient. This is a super-exponential improvement over the $\binom{n}{k}\sqrt{\pi k}/\epsilon^{2}$ scaling of prior approaches as $n$ can be arbitrarily larger than $\eta$ in natural problems. Our method, in the worst-case of half-filling, still provides a factor of $4^{k}$ advantage in sample complexity, and also estimates all $\eta$-reduced density matrices, applicable to estimating overlaps with all single Slater determinants, with at most $\frac{4}{3}/\epsilon^{2}$ samples, which is additionally independent of $\eta$.</description>

    <title>A hybrid framework for estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states</title>

    <description>Estimating nonlinear functions of quantum states, such as the moment $\tr(\rho^m)$, is of fundamental and practical interest in quantum science and technology. Here we show a quantum-classical hybrid framework to measure them, where the quantum part is constituted by the generalized swap test, and the classical part is realized by postprocessing the result from randomized measurements. This hybrid framework utilizes the partial coherent power of the intermediate-scale quantum processor and, at the same time, dramatically reduces the number of quantum measurements and the cost of classical postprocessing. We demonstrate the advantage of our framework in the tasks of state-moment estimation and quantum error mitigation.</description>

    <title>The grammar of the Ising model: A new complexity hierarchy</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08301</link>

    <description>How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii) constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this theorem to show that the 1d Ising model and the Ising model on layerwise complete graphs are constructive context free, and the 2d Ising model, the all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are constructive context sensitive. We also provide a grammar for the 1d and 2d Ising model. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical interactions in terms of grammars.</description>

    <title>Have your QEC and Bandwidth too!: A lightweight cryogenic decoder for common / trivial errors, and efficient bandwidth + execution management otherwise</title>

    <description>The overheads of classical decoding for quantum error correction grow rapidly with the number of logical qubits and their correction code distance. Decoding at room temperature is bottle-necked by refrigerator I/O bandwidth while cryogenic on-chip decoding is limited by area/power/thermal budget. To overcome these overheads, we are motivated by the observation that in the common case (over 90% of the time), error signatures are fairly trivial with high redundancy / sparsity, since the error correction codes are over-provisioned to be able to correct for uncommon worst-case complex scenarios (to ensure substantially low logical error rates). If suitably exploited, these trivial signatures can be decoded and corrected with insignificant overhead, thereby alleviating the bottlenecks described above, while still handling the worst-case complex signatures by state-of-the-art means. Our proposal, targeting Surface Codes, consists of: 1) A lightweight decoder for decoding and correcting trivial common-case errors, designed for the cryogenic domain. The decoder is implemented for SFQ logic. 2) A statistical confidence-based technique for off-chip decoding bandwidth allocation, to efficiently handle rare complex decodes which are not covered by the on-chip decoder. 3) A method for stalling circuit execution, for the worst-case scenarios in which the provisioned off-chip bandwidth is insufficient to complete all requested off-chip decodes. In all, our proposal enables 70-99+% off-chip bandwidth elimination across a range of logical and physical error rates, without significantly sacrificing the accuracy of state-of-the-art off-chip decoding. By doing so, it achieves 10-10000x bandwidth reduction over prior off-chip bandwidth reduction techniques. Furthermore, it achieves a 15-37x resource overhead reduction compared to prior on-chip-only decoding.</description>

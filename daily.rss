    <description>Error-mitigation techniques can enable access to accurate estimates of physical observables that are otherwise biased by noise in pre-fault-tolerant quantum computers. One particularly general error-mitigation technique is probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), which effectively inverts a well-characterized noise channel to produce noise-free estimates of observables. Experimental realizations of this technique, however, have been impeded by the challenge of learning correlated noise in large quantum circuits. In this work, we present a practical protocol for learning a sparse noise model that scales to large quantum devices and is efficient to learn and invert. These advances enable us to demonstrate PEC on a superconducting quantum processor with crosstalk errors, thereby revealing a path to error-mitigated quantum computation with noise-free observables at larger circuit volumes.</description>

    <description>The technological development of hardware heading toward universal fault-tolerant quantum computation requires a large-scale processing unit with high performance. While fluxonium qubits are promising with high coherence and large anharmonicity, their scalability has not been systematically explored. In this work, we propose a superconducting quantum information processor based on compact high-coherence fluxoniums with suppressed crosstalk, reduced design complexity, improved operational efficiency, high-fidelity gates, and resistance to parameter fluctuations. In this architecture, the qubits are readout dispersively using individual resonators connected to a common bus and manipulated via combined on-chip RF and DC control lines, both of which can be designed to have low crosstalk. A multi-path coupling approach enables exchange interactions between the high-coherence computational states and at the same time suppresses the spurious static ZZ rate, leading to fast and high-fidelity entangling gates. We numerically investigate the cross resonance controlled-NOT and the differential AC-Stark controlled-Z operations, revealing low gate error for qubit-qubit detuning bandwidth of up to 1 GHz. Our study on frequency crowding indicates high fabrication yield for quantum processors consisting of over thousands of qubits. In addition, we estimate low resource overhead to suppress logical error rate using the XZZX surface code. These results promise a scalable quantum architecture with high performance for the pursuit of universal quantum computation.</description>

    <description>Any architecture for practical quantum computing must be scalable. An attractive approach is to create multiple cores, computing regions of fixed size that are well-spaced but interlinked with communication channels. This exploded architecture can relax the demands associated with a single monolithic device: the complexity of control, cooling and power infrastructure as well as the difficulties of cross-talk suppression and near-perfect component yield. Here we explore interlinked multicore architectures through analytic and numerical modelling. While elements of our analysis are relevant to diverse platforms, our focus is on semiconductor electron spin systems in which numerous cores may exist on a single chip. We model shuttling and microwave-based interlinks and estimate the achievable fidelities, finding values that are encouraging but markedly inferior to intra-core operations. We therefore introduce optimsed entanglement purification to enable high-fidelity communication, finding that $99.5\%$ is a very realistic goal. We then assess the prospects for quantum advantage using such devices in the NISQ-era and beyond: we simulate recently proposed exponentially-powerful error mitigation schemes in the multicore environment and conclude that these techniques impressively suppress imperfections in both the inter- and intra-core operations.</description>

    <description>Quantum technology is full of figurative and literal noise obscuring its promise. In this overview, we will attempt to provide a sober assessment of the promise of quantum technology with a focus on computing. We provide a tour of quantum computing and quantum technology that is aimed to be comprehensible to scientists and engineers without becoming a popular account. The goal is not a comprehensive review nor a superficial introduction but rather to serve as a useful map to navigate the hype, the scientific literature, and upcoming press releases about quantum technology and quantum computing. We have aimed to cite the most recent topical reviews, key results, and guide the reader away from fallacies and towards active discussions in the current quantum computing literature. The goal of this article was to be pedantic and introductory without compromising on the science.</description>

    <title>Computable lower bounds on the entanglement cost of quantum channels</title>

    <description>A class of lower bounds for the entanglement cost of any quantum state was recently introduced in [arXiv:2111.02438] in the form of entanglement monotones known as the tempered robustness and tempered negativity. Here we extend their definitions to point-to-point quantum channels, establishing a lower bound for the entanglement cost of any channel, whether finite or infinite dimensional. This leads, in particular, to a bound that is computable as a semidefinite program and that can outperform previously known lower bounds, including ones based on quantum relative entropy. In the course of our proof we establish a useful link between the robustness of entanglement of quantum states and quantum channels, which requires several technical developments such as showing the lower semicontinuity of the robustness of entanglement of a channel in the weak*-operator topology on bounded linear maps between spaces of trace class operators.</description>

    <description>We develop an adaptive method for quantum state preparation that utilizes randomness as an essential component and that does not require classical optimization. Instead, a cost function is minimized to prepare a desired quantum state through an adaptively constructed quantum circuit, where each adaptive step is informed by feedback from gradient measurements in which the associated tangent space directions are randomized. We provide theoretical arguments and numerical evidence that convergence to the target state can be achieved for almost all initial states. We investigate different randomization procedures and develop lower bounds on the expected cost function change, which allows for drawing connections to barren plateaus and for assessing the applicability of the algorithm to large-scale problems.</description>

    <description>Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems classical computers never will. However, in order to capitalize on these prospects, a fully automated quantum software stack needs to be developed. This involves a multitude of complex tasks from the classical simulation of quantum circuits, over their compilation to specific devices, to the verification of the circuits to be executed as well as the obtained results. All of these tasks are highly non-trivial and necessitate efficient data structures to tackle the inherent complexity. Starting from rather straight-forward arrays over decision diagrams (inspired by the design automation community) to tensor networks and the ZX-calculus, various complementary approaches have been proposed. This work provides a look "under the hood" of today's tools and showcases how these means are utilized in them, e.g., for simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits.</description>

    <title>Clifford+$T$-gate Decomposition with Limited Number of $T$ gates, its Error Analysis, and Performance of Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz in Pre-FTQC Era</title>

    <description>Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) is essential to robustly implement quantum algorithms and thus to maximize advantages of quantum computers. In this context, a quantum circuit is decomposed into universal gates that can be fault-tolerantly implemented, for example, Clifford+$T$ gates. Here, $T$ gate is usually regarded as an essential resource for quantum computation because its action cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Practically, it is highly likely that only a limited number of $T$ gates are available in the near future due to its experimental difficulty of fault-tolerant implementation. In this paper, considering this Pre-FTQC era, we investigate Clifford+$T$ decomposition with a limited budget of $T$ gates and propose a new model of the error of such decomposition. More concretely, we propose an algorithm to generate the most accurate Clifford+$T$-gate decomposition of a given single-qubit rotation gate with a fixed number of $T$ gates. We also propose to model the error of Clifford+$T$ decomposition using well-known depolarizing noise by considering the average of the effects of the error. We numerically verified our model successfully explains the decomposition error for a wide variety of molecules using our decomposition algorithm. Thus, we shed light on a first-stage application of quantum computers from a practical point of view and fuel further research towards what quantum computation can achieve in the upcoming future.</description>

    <description>We give a classical $1/(qk+1)$-approximation for the maximum eigenvalue of $k$-sparse fermionic Hamiltonians with $q$-local terms as well as a $1/(4k+1)$-approximation when the Hamiltonian has both $2$-local and $4$-local terms</description>

    <title>One-Shot Distributed Source Simulation: As Quantum as it Can Get</title>

    <description>Distributed source simulation is the task where two (or more) parties share some correlated randomness and use local operations and no communication to convert this into some target correlation. Wyner's seminal result showed that asymptotically the rate of uniform shared randomness needed for this task is given by a mutual information induced measure, now referred to as Wyner's common information. This asymptotic result was extended by Hayashi in the quantum setting to separable states, the largest class of states for which this task can be performed. In this work we characterize this task in the one-shot setting using the smooth entropy framework. We do this by introducing one-shot operational quantities and correlation measures that characterize them. We establish asymptotic equipartition properties for our correlation measures thereby recovering, and in fact strengthening, the aforementioned asymptotic results. In doing so, we consider technical points in one-shot network information theory and generalize the support lemma to the classical-quantum setting. We also introduce entanglement versions of the distributed source simulation task and determine bounds in this setting via quantum embezzling.</description>

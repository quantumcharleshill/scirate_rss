    <title>Tight Bounds for State Tomography with Incoherent Measurements</title>

    <description>We consider the classic question of state tomography: given copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$, output $\widehat{\rho}$ for which $\|\rho - \widehat{\rho}\|_{\mathsf{tr}} \le \varepsilon$. When one is allowed to make coherent measurements entangled across all copies, $\Theta(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient [Haah et al. '17, O'Donnell-Wright '16]. Unfortunately, the protocols achieving this rate incur large quantum memory overheads that preclude implementation on current or near-term devices. On the other hand, the best known protocol using incoherent (single-copy) measurements uses $O(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies [Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17], and multiple papers have posed it as an open question to understand whether or not this rate is tight. In this work, we fully resolve this question, by showing that any protocol using incoherent measurements, even if they are chosen adaptively, requires $\Omega(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies, matching the upper bound of [Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17]. We do so by a new proof technique which directly bounds the "tilt" of the posterior distribution after measurements, which yields a surprisingly short proof of our lower bound, and which we believe may be of independent interest.</description>

    <description>Given a bipartite graph $G$, the graphical matrix space $\mathcal{S}_G$ consists of matrices whose non-zero entries can only be at those positions corresponding to edges in $G$. Tutte (J. London Math. Soc., 1947), Edmonds (J. Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Sect. B, 1967) and Lovász (FCT, 1979) observed connections between perfect matchings in $G$ and full-rank matrices in $\mathcal{S}_G$. Dieudonné (Arch. Math., 1948) proved a tight upper bound on the dimensions of those matrix spaces containing only singular matrices. The starting point of this paper is a simultaneous generalization of these two classical results: we show that the largest dimension over subspaces of $\mathcal{S}_G$ containing only singular matrices is equal to the maximum size over subgraphs of $G$ without perfect matchings, based on Meshulam's proof of Dieudonné's result (Quart. J. Math., 1985). Starting from this result, we go on to establish more connections between properties of graphs and matrix spaces. For example, we establish connections between acyclicity and nilpotency, between strong connectivity and irreducibility, and between isomorphism and conjugacy/congruence. For each connection, we study three types of correspondences, namely the basic correspondence, the inherited correspondence (for subgraphs and subspaces), and the induced correspondence (for induced subgraphs and restrictions). Some correspondences lead to intriguing generalizations of classical results, such as for Dieudonné's result mentioned above, and for a celebrated theorem of Gerstenhaber regarding the largest dimension of nil matrix spaces (Amer. J. Math., 1958). Finally, we show some implications of our results to quantum information and present open problems in computational complexity motivated by these results.</description>

    <title>Efficient tensor network simulation of quantum many-body physics on sparse graphs</title>

    <description>We study tensor network states defined on an underlying graph which is sparsely connected. Generic sparse graphs are expander graphs with a high probability, and one can represent volume law entangled states efficiently with only polynomial resources. We find that message-passing inference algorithms such as belief propagation can lead to efficient computation of local expectation values for a class of tensor network states defined on sparse graphs. As applications, we study local properties of square root states, graph states, and also employ this method to variationally prepare ground states of gapped Hamiltonians defined on generic graphs. Using the variational method we study the phase diagram of the transverse field quantum Ising model defined on sparse expander graphs.</description>

    <title>On the probabilistic quantum error correction</title>

    <description>Probabilistic quantum error correction is an error-correcting procedure which uses postselection to determine if the encoded information was successfully restored. In this work, we deeply analyze probabilistic version of the error-correcting procedure for general noise. We generalized the Knill-Laflamme conditions for probabilistically correctable errors. We show that for some noise channels, we should encode the information into a mixed state to maximize the probability of successful error correction. Finally, we investigate an advantage of the probabilistic error-correcting procedure over the deterministic one. Reducing the probability of successful error correction allows for correcting errors generated by a broader class of noise channels. Significantly, if the errors are caused by a unitary interaction with an auxiliary qubit system, we can probabilistically restore a qubit state by using only one additional physical qubit.</description>

    <title>Quantum space, ground space traversal, and how to embed multi-prover interactive proofs into unentanglement</title>

    <description>Savitch's theorem states that NPSPACE computations can be simulated in PSPACE. We initiate the study of a quantum analogue of NPSPACE, denoted Streaming-QCMASPACE (SQCMASPACE), where an exponentially long classical proof is streamed to a poly-space quantum verifier. Besides two main results, we also show that a quantum analogue of Savitch's theorem is unlikely to hold, as SQCMASPACE=NEXP. For completeness, we introduce Streaming-QMASPACE (SQMASPACE) with an exponentially long streamed quantum proof, and show SQMASPACE=QMA_EXP (quantum analogue of NEXP). Our first main result shows, in contrast to the classical setting, the solution space of a quantum constraint satisfaction problem (i.e. a local Hamiltonian) is always connected when exponentially long proofs are permitted. For this, we show how to simulate any Lipschitz continuous path on the unit hypersphere via a sequence of local unitary gates, at the expense of blowing up the circuit size. This shows quantum error-correcting codes can be unable to detect one codeword erroneously evolving to another if the evolution happens sufficiently slowly, and answers an open question of [Gharibian, Sikora, ICALP 2015] regarding the Ground State Connectivity problem. Our second main result is that any SQCMASPACE computation can be embedded into "unentanglement", i.e. into a quantum constraint satisfaction problem with unentangled provers. Formally, we show how to embed SQCMASPACE into the Sparse Separable Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012] (QMA(2)-complete for 1/poly promise gap), at the expense of scaling the promise gap with the streamed proof size. As a corollary, we obtain the first systematic construction for obtaining QMA(2)-type upper bounds on arbitrary multi-prover interactive proof systems, where the QMA(2) promise gap scales exponentially with the number of bits of communication in the interactive proof.</description>

    <description>Recently, Chia, Chung and Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron and Menda (STOC 2020) have shown that there exists an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathsf{BQP}^\mathcal{O} \neq (\mathsf{BPP^{BQNC}})^\mathcal{O} \cup (\mathsf{BQNC^{BPP}})^\mathcal{O}$. In fact, Chia et al. proved a stronger statement: for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an oracle that separates quantum depth $d$ and $2d+1$, when polynomial-time classical computation is allowed. This implies that relative to an oracle, doubling quantum depth gives classical and quantum hybrid schemes more computational power. In this paper, we show that for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an oracle that separates quantum depth $d$ and $d+1$, when polynomial-time classical computation is allowed. This gives an optimal oracle separation of classical and quantum hybrid schemes. To prove our result, we consider $d$-Bijective Shuffling Simon's Problem (which is a variant of $d$-Shuffling Simon's Problem considered by Chia et al.) and an oracle inspired by an "in-place" permutation oracle.</description>

    <description>Exploring quantum applications of near-term quantum devices is a rapidly growing field of quantum information science with both theoretical and practical interests. A leading paradigm to establish such near-term quantum applications is variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). These algorithms use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit to accomplish certain tasks, where the circuits are usually randomly initialized. In this work, we prove that for a broad class of such random circuits, the variation range of the cost function via adjusting any local quantum gate within the circuit vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits with a high probability. This result can unify the restrictions on gradient-based and gradient-free optimizations in a natural manner and reveal extra harsh constraints on the training landscapes of VQAs. Hence a fundamental limitation on the trainability of VQAs is unraveled, indicating the essence of the optimization hardness in the Hilbert space with exponential dimension. We further showcase the validity of our results with numerical simulations of representative VQAs. We believe that these results would deepen our understanding of the scalability of VQAs and shed light on the search for near-term quantum applications with advantages.</description>

    <title>Classical verification of quantum depth</title>

    <description>We present two protocols for classical verification of quantum depth. Our protocols allow a purely classical verifier to distinguish devices with different quantum circuit depths even in the presence of classical computation. We show that a device with quantum circuit depth at most d will be rejected by the verifier even if the prover applies additional polynomial-time classical computation to cheat. On the other hand, the verifier accepts a device which has quantum circuit depth d' for some d'>d. In our first protocol, we introduce an additional untrusted quantum machine which shares entanglements with the target machine. Applying a robust self-test, our first protocol certifies the depth of the target machine with information theoretic security and nearly optimal separation. The protocol relies on the oracle separation problem for quantum depth by Chia, Chung and Lai [STOC 2020] and a transformation from an oracle separation problem to a two-player non-local game. Our second protocol certifies the quantum depth of a single device based on quantum hardness of learning with errors. The protocol relies on the noisy trapdoor claw-free function family and the idea of pointer chasing to force the prover to keep quantum coherence until all preceding message exchanges are completed. To our knowledge, we give the first constructions for distinguishing hybrid quantum-classical computers with different circuit depths in unrelativized models.</description>

    <title>Arkhipov's theorem, graph minors, and linear system nonlocal games</title>

    <description>The perfect quantum strategies of a linear system game correspond to certain representations of its solution group. We study the solution groups of graph incidence games, which are linear system games in which the underlying linear system is the incidence system of a (non-properly) two-coloured graph. While it is undecidable to determine whether a general linear system game has a perfect quantum strategy, for graph incidence games this problem is solved by Arkhipov's theorem, which states that the graph incidence game of a connected graph has a perfect quantum strategy if and only if it either has a perfect classical strategy, or the graph is nonplanar. Arkhipov's criterion can be rephrased as a forbidden minor condition on connected two-coloured graphs. We extend Arkhipov's theorem by showing that, for graph incidence games of connected two-coloured graphs, every quotient closed property of the solution group has a forbidden minor characterization. We rederive Arkhipov's theorem from the group theoretic point of view, and then find the forbidden minors for two new properties: finiteness and abelianness. Our methods are entirely combinatorial, and finding the forbidden minors for other quotient closed properties seems to be an interesting combinatorial problem.</description>

    <title>Short Proofs of Linear Growth of Quantum Circuit Complexity</title>

    <description>The complexity of a quantum gate, defined as the minimal number of elementary gates to build it, is an important concept in quantum information and computation. It is shown recently that the complexity of quantum gates built from random quantum circuits almost surely grows linearly with the number of building blocks. In this article, we provide two short proofs of this fact. We also discuss a discrete version of quantum circuit complexity growth.</description>

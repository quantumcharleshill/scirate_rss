    <description>Kernel methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) have recently gained significant attention as a potential candidate for achieving a quantum advantage in data analysis. Among other attractive properties, when training a kernel-based model one is guaranteed to find the optimal model's parameters due to the convexity of the training landscape. However, this is based on the assumption that the quantum kernel can be efficiently obtained from a quantum hardware. In this work we study the trainability of quantum kernels from the perspective of the resources needed to accurately estimate kernel values. We show that, under certain conditions, values of quantum kernels over different input data can be exponentially concentrated (in the number of qubits) towards some fixed value, leading to an exponential scaling of the number of measurements required for successful training. We identify four sources that can lead to concentration including: the expressibility of data embedding, global measurements, entanglement and noise. For each source, an associated concentration bound of quantum kernels is analytically derived. Lastly, we show that when dealing with classical data, training a parametrized data embedding with a kernel alignment method is also susceptible to exponential concentration. Our results are verified through numerical simulations for several QML tasks. Altogether, we provide guidelines indicating that certain features should be avoided to ensure the efficient evaluation and the trainability of quantum kernel methods.</description>

    <title>Solvable model of deep thermalization with distinct design times</title>

    <description>We study the emergence over time of a universal, uniform distribution of quantum states on a finite subsystem, induced by projectively measuring the rest of the system. Dubbed deep thermalization, this phenomenon represents a form of equilibration in quantum many-body systems stronger than regular thermalization, which only constrains the ensemble-averaged values of observables. While there exist quantum circuit models of dynamics in one dimension where this phenomenon can be shown to arise exactly, these are special in that deep thermalization occurs at precisely the same time as regular thermalization. Here, we present an exactly-solvable model of chaotic dynamics where the two processes can be shown to occur over different time scales. The model is composed of a finite subsystem coupled to an infinite random-matrix bath through a small constriction, and highlights the role of locality and imperfect thermalization in constraining the formation of such universal wavefunction distributions. We test our analytical predictions against exact numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement.</description>

    <title>Revealing measurement-induced phase transitions by pre-selection</title>

    <description>Pushing forward the understanding of general non-unitary dynamics in controlled quantum platforms has been fueled by the recent discovery of measurement-induced phases and phase transitions. So far, these transitions remained largely elusive, since they are masked in standard quantum mechanical observables due to the randomness of measurement outcomes. Here, we establish a general scheme -- pre-selection -- to make them observable: The outcome randomness is broken explicitly by steering the system towards a representative state, which corresponds to one out of exponentially many possible measurement outcomes. Remarkably, this steering can be chosen so gently that the basic properties of the underlying measurement-induced transition, such as entanglement structure and critical exponents, are not modified. Pre-selection introduces a unique dark or absorbing state with macroscopic order, replacing the maximally mixed stationary state of the unconditioned measurement trajectory ensemble. This creates a link of measurement-induced phase transitions to new forms of quantum absorbing state transitions, which can be detected by standard means via a local order parameter. This insight further enables a quantum simulation strategy, determining the underlying universality class in state-of-the-art quantum platforms without measurement readout.</description>

    <title>Measurement-Prepared Quantum Criticality: from Ising model to gauge theory, and beyond</title>

    <description>Measurements allow efficient preparation of interesting quantum many-body states exhibiting long-range, topological, or fractonic orders. Here, we prove that the so-called conformal quantum critical points (CQCP) can be obtained by performing general single-site measurements in appropriate basis on the cluster states in $d\geq2$. The equal-time correlators of the said states are described by correlation functions of a certain $d$-dimensional classical model at the critical temperature, featuring spatial conformal invariance. This establishes an exact correspondence between the measurement-prepared critical states and conformal field theories of a range of critical spin models, including familiar Ising model and gauge theories among others. Furthermore, by mapping the correlations of the measured quantum state into the statistical mechanics problem, we establish the stability of long-range or topological orders with respect to measurements deviating from the ideal setting, without any post-selection. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which a quantum critical wavefunction emerges, providing new practical ways to study quantum phases and conformal quantum critical points.</description>

    <title>A Theorem on Extensive Spectral Degeneracy for Systems with Higher Symmetries in General Dimensions</title>

    <description>We establish, in the spirit of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, lower bounds on the spectral degeneracy of quantum systems with higher (Gauge Like) symmetries with rather generic physical boundary conditions in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. Contrary to applying twists or equivalent adiabatic operations, we exploit the effects of modified boundary conditions. When a general choice of boundary geometry is immaterial in approaching the thermodynamic limit, systems that exhibit non-commuting Gauge Like symmetries, such as the orbital compass model, must have an exponential (in the size of the boundary) degeneracy of each of their spectral levels. We briefly discuss why, in spite of the proven large degeneracy associated with infrared-ultraviolet mixing, some systems may still exhibit conventional physical behaviors, i.e., of those of systems with non-extensive degeneracies, due to entropic "order by disorder" type effects.</description>

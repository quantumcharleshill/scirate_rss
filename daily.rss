    <description>The NLTS (No Low-Energy Trivial State) conjecture of Freedman and Hastings [2014] posits that there exist families of Hamiltonians with all low energy states of high complexity (with complexity measured by the quantum circuit depth preparing the state). Here, we prove a weaker version called the combinatorial NLTS, where a quantum circuit lower bound is shown against states that violate a (small) constant fraction of local terms. This generalizes the prior NLETS results (Eldar and Harrow [2017]; Nirkhe, Vazirani and Yuen [2018]). Our construction is obtained by combining tensor networks with expander codes (Sipser and Spielman [1996]). The Hamiltonian is the parent Hamiltonian of a perturbed tensor network, inspired by the `uncle Hamiltonian' of Fernandez-Gonzalez et. al. [2015]. Thus, we deviate from the quantum CSS code Hamiltonians considered in most prior works.</description>

    <title>Emergence of Kac-Moody Symmetry in Critical Quantum Spin Chains</title>

    <description>Given a critical quantum spin chain with a microscopic Lie-group symmetry, corresponding e.g. to $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ spin isotropy, we numerically investigate the emergence of Kac-Moody symmetry at low energies and long distances. In that regime, one such critical quantum spin chain is described by a conformal field theory where the usual Virasoro algebra associated to conformal invariance is augmented with a Kac-Moody algebra associated to conserved currents. Specifically, we first propose a method to construct lattice operators corresponding to the Kac-Moody generators. We then numerically show that, when projected onto low energy states of the quantum spin chain, these operators indeed approximately fulfill the Kac-Moody algebra. The lattice version of the Kac-Moody generators allow us to compute the so-called level constant and to organize the low-energy eigenstates of the lattice Hamiltonian into Kac-Moody towers. We illustrate the proposal with the XXZ model and the Heisenberg model with a next-to-nearest-neighbor coupling.</description>

    <description>The unique gauge- and coordinate-covariant derivative needed to differentiate and parallel transport tangent vectors and other geometric objects in quantum mechanics is introduced. Formulas are given for the curvature and holonomy of the connection. Using the quantum covariant derivative, adiabatic perturbation theory is phrased in geometric terms.</description>

    <title>Improving Quantum Computation by Optimized Qubit Routing</title>

    <description>In this work we propose a high-quality decomposition approach for qubit routing by swap insertion. This optimization problem arises in the context of compiling quantum algorithms onto specific quantum hardware. Our approach decomposes the routing problem into an allocation subproblem and a set of token swapping problems. This allows us to tackle the allocation part and the token swapping part separately. Extracting the allocation part from the qubit routing model of Nannicini et al.\ (\citenannicini2021), we formulate the allocation subproblem as a binary program. Herein, we employ a cost function that is a lower bound on the overall routing problem objective. We strengthen the linear relaxation by novel valid inequalities. For the token swapping part we develop an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. In this context, we improve upon known lower bounds on the token swapping problem. Furthermore, we enhance an existing approximation algorithm. We present numerical results for the integrated allocation and token swapping problem. Obtained solutions may not be globally optimal due to the decomposition and the usage of an approximation algorithm. However, the solutions are obtained fast and are typically close to optimal. In addition, there is a significant reduction in the number of gates and output circuit depth when compared to state-of-the-art heuristics. Reducing these figures is crucial for minimizing noise when running quantum algorithms on near-term hardware. As a consequence, using the novel decomposition approach leads to compiled algorithms with improved quality. Indeed, when compiled with the novel routing procedure and executed on real hardware, our experimental results for quantum approximate optimization algorithms show an significant increase in solution quality in comparison to standard routing methods.</description>

    <title>Quantum Complexity of Weighted Diameter and Radius in CONGEST Networks</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02767</link>

    <description>This paper studies the round complexity of computing the weighted diameter and radius of a graph in the quantum CONGEST model. We present a quantum algorithm that $(1+o(1))$-approximates the diameter and radius with round complexity $\widetilde O\left(\min\left\{n^{9/10}D^{3/10},n\right\}\right)$, where $D$ denotes the unweighted diameter. This exhibits the advantages of quantum communication over classical communication since computing a $(3/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation of the diameter and radius in a classical CONGEST network takes $\widetilde\Omega(n)$ rounds, even if $D$ is constant [Abboud, Censor-Hillel, and Khoury, DISC '16]. We also prove a lower bound of $\widetilde\Omega(n^{2/3})$ for $(3/2-\varepsilon)$-approximating the weighted diameter/radius in quantum CONGEST networks, even if $D=\Theta(\log n)$. Thus, in quantum CONGEST networks, computing weighted diameter and weighted radius of graphs with small $D$ is strictly harder than unweighted ones due to Le Gall and Magniez's $\widetilde O\left(\sqrt{nD}\right)$-round algorithm for unweighted diameter/radius [PODC '18].</description>

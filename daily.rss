    <description>Executing quantum algorithms on error-corrected logical qubits is a critical step for scalable quantum computing, but the requisite numbers of qubits and physical error rates are demanding for current experimental hardware. Recently, the development of error correcting codes tailored to particular physical noise models has helped relax these requirements. In this work, we propose a qubit encoding and gate protocol for ${}^{171}$Yb neutral atom qubits that converts the dominant physical errors into erasures, that is, errors in known locations. The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that 98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations. Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.</description>

    <title>Quantum Distributed Algorithms for Detection of Cliques</title>

    <description>The possibilities offered by quantum computing have drawn attention in the distributed computing community recently, with several breakthrough results showing quantum distributed algorithms that run faster than the fastest known classical counterparts, and even separations between the two models. A prime example is the result by Izumi, Le Gall, and Magniez [STACS 2020], who showed that triangle detection by quantum distributed algorithms is easier than triangle listing, while an analogous result is not known in the classical case. In this paper we present a framework for fast quantum distributed clique detection. This improves upon the state-of-the-art for the triangle case, and is also more general, applying to larger clique sizes. Our main technical contribution is a new approach for detecting cliques by encapsulating this as a search task for nodes that can be added to smaller cliques. To extract the best complexities out of our approach, we develop a framework for nested distributed quantum searches, which employ checking procedures that are quantum themselves. Moreover, we show a circuit-complexity barrier on proving a lower bound of the form $\Omega(n^{3/5+\epsilon})$ for $K_p$-detection for any $p \geq 4$, even in the classical (non-quantum) distributed CONGEST setting.</description>

    <title>Snowmass White Paper: Quantum Aspects of Black Holes and the Emergence of Spacetime</title>

    <description>Black holes provide a window into the microscopic structure of spacetime in quantum gravity. Recently the quantum information contained in Hawking radiation has been calculated, verifying a key aspect of the consistency of black hole evaporation with quantum mechanical unitarity. This calculation relied crucially on recent progress in understanding the emergence of bulk spacetime from a boundary holographic description. Spacetime wormholes have played an important role in understanding the underpinnings of this result, and the precision study of such wormholes, in this and other contexts, has been enabled by the development of low-dimensional models of holography. In this white paper we review these developments and describe some of the deep open questions in this subject. These include the nature of the black hole interior, potential applications to quantum cosmology, the gravitational explanation of the fine structure of black holes, and the development of further connections to quantum information and laboratory quantum simulation.</description>

    <title>QAOA pseudo-Boltzmann states</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03358</link>

    <description>In this letter, we provide analytical and numerical evidence that the single-layer Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on universal Ising spin models produces thermal states with Gaussian perturbations. We find that these pseudo-Boltzman states can not be efficiently simulated on classical computers according to state-of-art techniques, and we relate this distribution to the optimization potential of QAOA. Moreover, we observe that the temperature depends on a hidden universal correlation between the energy of a state and the covariance of other energy levels and the Hamming distances of the state to those energies.</description>

    <title>Truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models as extended TQFTs</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03284</link>

    <description>We construct extended TQFTs associated to Rozansky--Witten models with target manifolds $T^*\mathbb{C}^n$. The starting point of the construction is the 3-category whose objects are such Rozansky--Witten models, and whose morphisms are defects of all codimensions. By truncation, we obtain a (non-semisimple) 2-category $\mathcal{C}$ of bulk theories, surface defects, and isomorphism classes of line defects. Through a systematic application of the cobordism hypothesis we construct a unique extended oriented 2-dimensional TQFT valued in $\mathcal{C}$ for every affine Rozansky--Witten model. By evaluating this TQFT on closed surfaces we obtain the infinite-dimensional state spaces (graded by flavour and R-charges) of the initial 3-dimensional theory. Furthermore, we explicitly compute the commutative Frobenius algebras that classify the restrictions of the extended theories to circles and bordisms between them.</description>

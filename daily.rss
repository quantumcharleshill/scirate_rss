    <title>Non-Pauli Errors in the Three-Dimensional Surface Code</title>

    <description>A powerful feature of stabiliser error correcting codes is the fact that stabiliser measurement projects arbitrary errors to Pauli errors, greatly simplifying the physical error correction process as well as classical simulations of code performance. However, logical non-Clifford operations can map Pauli errors to non-Pauli (Clifford) errors, and while subsequent stabiliser measurements will project the Clifford errors back to Pauli errors the resulting distributions will possess additional correlations that depend on both the nature of the logical operation and the structure of the code. Previous work has studied these effects when applying a transversal $T$ gate to the three-dimensional colour code and shown the existence of a non-local "linking charge" phenomenon between membranes of intersecting errors. In this work we generalise these results to the case of a $CCZ$ gate in the three-dimensional surface code and find that many aspects of the problem are much more easily understood in this setting. In particular, the emergence of linking charge is a local effect rather than a non-local one. We use the relative simplicity of Clifford errors in this setting to simulate their effect on the performance of a single-shot magic state preparation process (the first such simulation to account for the full effect of these errors) and find that while they lead to an increase in the logical error rate their effect on the threshold is minimal.</description>

    <title>Three-dimensional quantum cellular automata from chiral semion surface topological order and beyond</title>

    <description>We construct a novel three-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) based on a system with short-range entangled bulk and chiral semion boundary topological order. We argue that either the QCA is nontrivial, i.e. not a finite-depth circuit of local quantum gates, or there exists a two-dimensional commuting projector Hamiltonian realizing the chiral semion topological order (characterized by $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory). Our QCA is obtained by first constructing the Walker-Wang Hamiltonian of a certain premodular tensor category of order four, then condensing the deconfined bulk boson at the level of lattice operators. We show that the resulting Hamiltonian hosts chiral semion surface topological order in the presence of a boundary and can be realized as a non-Pauli stabilizer code on qubits, from which the QCA is defined. The construction is then generalized to a class of QCAs defined by non-Pauli stabilizer codes on ${2^n}$-dimensional qudits that feature surface anyons described by $U(1)_{2^n}$ Chern-Simons theory. Our results support the conjecture that the group of nontrivial three-dimensional QCAs is isomorphic to the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories.</description>

    <title>Matrix concentration inequalities and efficiency of random universal sets of quantum gates</title>

    <description>For a random set $\mathcal{S}$ of quantum gates we provide bounds on the probability that $\mathcal{S}$ forms a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design. In particular we show how many random gates are needed to have a $\delta$-approximate $t$-design with high probability. We also analyze how $\delta$ concentrates around its expected value $\mathbb{E}\delta$ for random $\mathcal{S}$. Our results are valid for both symmetric and non-symmetric sets of gates.</description>

    <title>Neural-Network Decoders for Quantum Error Correction using Surface Codes:A Space Exploration of the Hardware Cost-Performance Trade-Offs</title>

    <description>Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is required in quantum computers to mitigate the effect of errors on physical qubits. When adopting a QEC scheme based on surface codes, error decoding is the most computationally expensive task in the classical electronic back-end. Decoders employing neural networks (NN) are well-suited for this task but their hardware implementation has not been presented yet. This work presents a space exploration of fully-connected feed-forward NN decoders for small distance surface codes. The goal is to optimize the neural network for high decoding performance, while keeping a minimalistic hardware implementation. This is needed to meet the tight delay constraints of real-time surface code decoding. We demonstrate that hardware based NN-decoders can achieve high decoding performance comparable to other state-of-the-art decoding algorithms whilst being well below the tight delay requirements $(\approx 440\ \mathrm{ns})$ of current solid-state qubit technologies for both ASIC designs $(<30\ \mathrm{ns})$ and FPGA implementations $(<90\ \mathrm{ns})$. These results designates NN-decoders as fitting candidates for an integrated hardware implementation in future large-scale quantum computers.</description>

    <title>Engineered Dissipation for Quantum Information Science</title>

    <description>Quantum information processing relies on precise control of non-classical states in the presence of many uncontrolled environmental degrees of freedom -- requiring careful orchestration of how the relevant degrees of freedom interact with that environment. These interactions are often viewed as detrimental, as they dissipate energy and decohere quantum states. Nonetheless, when controlled, dissipation is an essential tool for manipulating quantum information: Dissipation engineering enables quantum measurement, quantum state preparation, and quantum state stabilization. The progress of quantum device technology, marked by improvements of characteristic coherence times and extensible architectures for quantum control, has coincided with the development of such dissipation engineering tools which interface quantum and classical degrees of freedom. This Review presents dissipation as a fundamental aspect of the measurement and control of quantum devices and highlights the role of dissipation engineering for quantum error correction and quantum simulation that enables quantum information processing on a practical scale.</description>

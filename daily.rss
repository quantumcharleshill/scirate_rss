    <title>On a gap in the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma and its consequences for the reversibility of quantum resources</title>

    <description>We show that the proof of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Brandão & Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 791 (2010)] is not correct due to a gap in the argument leading to Lemma III.9. Hence, the main achievability result of Brandão & Plenio is not known to hold. This puts into question a number of established results in the literature, in particular the reversibility of quantum entanglement [Brandão & Plenio, Commun. Math. Phys. 295, 829 (2010); Nat. Phys. 4, 873 (2008)] and of general quantum resources [Brandão & Gour, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 070503 (2015)] under asymptotically resource non-generating operations. We discuss potential ways to recover variants of the newly unsettled results using other approaches.</description>

    <title>Adaptive constant-depth circuits for manipulating non-abelian anyons</title>

    <description>We consider Kitaev's quantum double model based on a finite group $G$ and describe quantum circuits for (a) preparation of the ground state, (b) creation of anyon pairs separated by an arbitrary distance, and (c) non-destructive topological charge measurement. We show that for any solvable group $G$ all above tasks can be realized by constant-depth adaptive circuits with geometrically local unitary gates and mid-circuit measurements. Each gate may be chosen adaptively depending on previous measurement outcomes. Constant-depth circuits are well suited for implementation on a noisy hardware since it may be possible to execute the entire circuit within the qubit coherence time. Thus our results could facilitate an experimental study of exotic phases of matter with a non-abelian particle statistics. We also show that adaptiveness is essential for our circuit construction. Namely, task (b) cannot be realized by non-adaptive constant-depth local circuits for any non-abelian group $G$. This is in a sharp contrast with abelian anyons which can be created and moved over an arbitrary distance by a depth-$1$ circuit composed of generalized Pauli gates.</description>

    <title>Group-Invariant Quantum Machine Learning</title>

    <description>Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models are aimed at learning from data encoded in quantum states. Recently, it has been shown that models with little to no inductive biases (i.e., with no assumptions about the problem embedded in the model) are likely to have trainability and generalization issues, especially for large problem sizes. As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that encode as much information as available about the problem at hand. In this work we present a simple, yet powerful, framework where the underlying invariances in the data are used to build QML models that, by construction, respect those symmetries. These so-called group-invariant models produce outputs that remain invariant under the action of any element of the symmetry group $\mathfrak{G}$ associated to the dataset. We present theoretical results underpinning the design of $\mathfrak{G}$-invariant models, and exemplify their application through several paradigmatic QML classification tasks including cases when $\mathfrak{G}$ is a continuous Lie group and also when it is a discrete symmetry group. Notably, our framework allows us to recover, in an elegant way, several well known algorithms for the literature, as well as to discover new ones. Taken together, we expect that our results will help pave the way towards a more geometric and group-theoretic approach to QML model design.</description>

    <title>Soft Syndrome Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes for Joint Correction of Data and Syndrome Errors</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02341</link>

    <description>Quantum errors are primarily detected and corrected using the measurement of syndrome information which itself is an unreliable step in practical error correction implementations. Typically, such faulty or noisy syndrome measurements are modeled as a binary measurement outcome flipped with some probability. However, the measured syndrome is in fact a discretized value of the continuous voltage or current values obtained in the physical implementation of the syndrome extraction. In this paper, we use this "soft" or analog information without the conventional discretization step to benefit the iterative decoders for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. Syndrome-based iterative belief propagation decoders are modified to utilize the syndrome-soft information to successfully correct both data and syndrome errors simultaneously, without repeated measurements. We demonstrate the advantages of extracting the soft information from the syndrome in our improved decoders, not only in terms of comparison of thresholds and logical error rates for quasi-cyclic lifted-product QLDPC code families, but also for faster convergence of iterative decoders. In particular, the new BP decoder with noisy syndrome performs as good as the standard BP decoder under ideal syndrome.</description>

    <title>Magic of the ground state of the transverse field Ising model</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02247</link>

    <description>Ground states of quantum many-body systems are both entangled and possess a kind of quantum complexity as their preparation requires universal resources that go beyond the Clifford group and stabilizer states. These resources - sometimes dubbed as magic - are also the crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. We study the behavior of the stabilizer Rényi entropy in the integrable transverse field Ising spin chain. We show that the locality of interactions results in a localized stabilizer Rényi entropy in the gapped phase thus making this quantity computable in terms of local quantities in the gapped phase, while measurements involving $L$ spins are necessary at the critical point to obtain an error scaling with $O(L^{-1})$.</description>

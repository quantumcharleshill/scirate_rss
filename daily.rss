    <title>Uncertainty relations from graph theory</title>

    <description>Quantum measurements are inherently probabilistic. Further defying our classical intuition, quantum theory often forbids us to precisely determine the outcomes of simultaneous measurements. This phenomenon is captured and quantified through uncertainty relations. Although studied since the inception of quantum theory, this problem of determining the possible expectation values of a collection of quantum measurements remains, in general, unsolved. By constructing a close connection between observables and graph theory, we derive uncertainty relations valid for any set of dichotomic observables. These relations are, in many cases, tight, and related to the size of the maximum clique of the associated graph. As applications, they can be straightforwardly used to build entropic uncertainty relations, separability criteria and entanglement witnesses.</description>

    <title>Cryptography with Certified Deletion</title>

    <description>We propose a new, unifying framework that yields an array of cryptographic primitives with certified deletion. These primitives enable a party in possession of a quantum ciphertext to generate a classical certificate that the encrypted plaintext has been information-theoretically deleted, and cannot be recovered even given unbounded computational resources. For any $X \in \{\mathsf{public}\text{-}\mathsf{key},\mathsf{attribute\text{-}based},\mathsf{fully\text{-}homomorphic}, \mathsf{witness},\mathsf{timed}\text{-}\mathsf{release}\}$, our compiler yields post-quantum $X$ encryption with certified deletion, assuming post-quantum $X$ encryption. In addition, assuming the existence of statistically binding commitments, our compiler yields statistically binding commitments with certified everlasting hiding as well as statistically sound zero-knowledge proofs for QMA with certified everlasting zero-knowledge. We also introduce and construct information-theoretic secret sharing with certified deletion. Existing proposals~\citeEC:Unruh14,10.1007/978-3-030-92062-3_21,cryptoeprint:2021:1315,cryptoeprint:2022:295 for public-key primitives and commitments with certified deletion (1) have complex constructions tailored to specific primitives and non-generic proofs, (2) are not known to satisfy everlasting security after deletion in the plain model, and in many cases (3) resort to idealized models or stronger cryptographic assumptions like obfuscation. We remedy this situation by developing a novel proof technique to argue that a bit $b$ has been \em information-theoretically deleted from an adversary's view once they produce a valid deletion certificate, despite having been previously \em determined by the ciphertext they held in their view. This may be of independent interest.</description>

    <title>Characterizing low-frequency qubit noise</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01740</link>

    <description>Fluctuations of the qubit frequencies are one of the major problems to overcome on the way to scalable quantum computers. Of particular importance are fluctuations with the correlation time that exceeds the decoherence time due to decay and dephasing by fast processes. The statistics of the fluctuations can be characterized by measuring the correlators of the outcomes of periodically repeated Ramsey measurements. This work suggests a method that allows describing qubit dynamics during repeated measurements in the presence of evolving noise. It made it possible, in particular, to evaluate the two-time correlator for the noise from two-level systems and obtain two- and three-time correlators for a Gaussian noise. The explicit expressions for the correlators are compared with simulations. A significant difference of the three-time correlators for the noise from two-level systems and for a Gaussian noise is demonstrated. Strong broadening of the distribution of the outcomes of Ramsey measurements, with a possible fine structure, is found for the data acquisition time comparable to the noise correlation time.</description>

    <title>Securing the Objectivity of Relative Facts in the Quantum World</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01966</link>
    <author>Richard Healey</author>
    <pubDate>Jul 06 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This paper compares and contrasts relational quantum mechanics (RQM) with a pragmatist view of quantum theory (DP). I'll first explain important points of agreement. Then I'll point to two problems faced by RQM and sketch DP's solutions to analogous problems. Since both RQM and DP have taken the Born rule to require relative facts I next say what these might be. This brings me to my main objection to RQM as originally conceived -- that its ontology of relative facts is incompatible with scientific objectivity and undercuts the evidential base of quantum theory. In contrast DP's relative facts have all the objectivity we need to accept quantum theory as scientific knowledge. But a very recent modification to RQM has successfully addressed my main objection, bringing the two views into even closer alignment.</description>

    <title>Positive maps and entanglement in real Hilbert spaces</title>

    <description>The theory of positive maps plays a central role in operator algebras and functional analysis, and has countless applications in quantum information science. The theory was originally developed for operators acting on complex Hilbert spaces, and little is known about its variant on real Hilbert spaces. In this article we study positive maps acting on a full matrix algebra over the reals, pointing out a number of fundamental differences with the complex case and discussing their implications in quantum information. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a real map to admit a positive complexification, and connect the existence of positive maps with non-positive complexification with the existence of mixed states that are entangled in real Hilbert space quantum mechanics, but separable in the complex version, providing explicit examples both for the maps and for the states. Finally, we discuss entanglement breaking and PPT maps, and we show that a straightforward real version of the PPT-squared conjecture is false even in dimension 2. Nevertheless, we show that the original PPT-squared conjecture implies a different conjecture for real maps, in which the PPT property is replaced by a stronger property of invariance under partial transposition (IPT). When the IPT property is assumed, we prove an asymptotic version of the conjecture.</description>

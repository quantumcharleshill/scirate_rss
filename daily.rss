    <description>For certain restricted computational tasks, quantum mechanics provides a provable advantage over any possible classical implementation. Several of these results have been proven using the framework of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), where non-locality and more generally contextuality have been identified as necessary resources for certain quantum computations. Here, we consider the computational power of MBQC in more detail by refining its resource requirements, both on the allowed operations and the number of accessible qubits. More precisely, we identify which Boolean functions can be computed in non-adaptive MBQC, with local operations contained within a finite level in the Clifford hierarchy. Moreover, for non-adaptive MBQC restricted to certain subtheories such as stabiliser MBQC, we compute the minimal number of qubits required to compute a given Boolean function. Our results point towards hierarchies of resources that more sharply characterise the power of MBQC beyond the binary of contextuality vs non-contextuality.</description>

    <title>Quantum Algorithms for Testing Hamiltonian Symmetry</title>

    <description>Symmetries in a Hamiltonian play an important role in quantum physics because they correspond directly with conserved quantities of the related system. In this paper, we propose quantum algorithms capable of testing whether a Hamiltonian exhibits symmetry with respect to a group. We demonstrate that familiar expressions of Hamiltonian symmetry in quantum mechanics correspond directly with the acceptance probabilities of our algorithms. We execute one of our symmetry-testing algorithms on existing quantum computers for simple examples of both symmetric and asymmetric cases.</description>

    <description>We give a novel procedure for approximating general single-qubit unitaries from a finite universal gate set by reducing the problem to a novel magnitude approximation problem, achieving an immediate improvement in sequence length by a factor of 7/9. Extending the works arXiv:1612.01011 and arXiv:1612.02689, we show that taking probabilistic mixtures of channels to solve fallback (arXiv:1409.3552) and magnitude approximation problems saves factor of two in approximation costs. In particular, over the Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$ gate set we achieve an average non-Clifford gate count of $0.23\log_2(1/\varepsilon)+2.13$ and T-count $0.56\log_2(1/\varepsilon)+5.3$ with mixed fallback approximations for diamond norm accuracy $\varepsilon$. This paper provides a holistic overview of gate approximation, in addition to these new insights. We give an end-to-end procedure for gate approximation for general gate sets related to some quaternion algebras, providing pedagogical examples using common fault-tolerant gate sets (V, Clifford+T and Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$). We also provide detailed numerical results for Clifford+T and Clifford+$\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$ gate sets. In an effort to keep the paper self-contained, we include an overview of the relevant algorithms for integer point enumeration and relative norm equation solving. We provide a number of further applications of the magnitude approximation problems, as well as improved algorithms for exact synthesis, in the Appendices.</description>

    <title>Improving Quantum Simulation Efficiency of Final State Radiation with Dynamic Quantum Circuits</title>

    <description>Reference arXiv:1904.03196 recently introduced an algorithm (QPS) for simulating parton showers with intermediate flavor states using polynomial resources on a digital quantum computer. We make use of a new quantum hardware capability called dynamical quantum computing to improve the scaling of this algorithm to significantly improve the method precision. In particular, we modify the quantum parton shower circuit to incorporate mid-circuit qubit measurements, resets, and quantum operations conditioned on classical information. This reduces the computational depth from $\mathcal{O}(N^5\log_2(N)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^3\log_2(N)^2)$ and the qubit requirements are reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2(N))$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Using "matrix product state" statevector simulators, we demonstrate that the improved algorithm yields expected results for 2, 3, 4, and 5-steps of the algorithm. We compare absolute costs with the original QPS algorithm, and show that dynamical quantum computing can significantly reduce costs in the class of digital quantum algorithms representing quantum walks (which includes the QPS).</description>

    <title>Strict Hierarchy of Strategies for Non-asymptotic Quantum Metrology</title>

    <description>One of the main quests in quantum metrology is to determine the ultimate precision limit with given resources, where the resources are not only of the number of queries, but more importantly of the allowed strategies. With the same number of queries, the restrictions on the strategies constrain the achievable precision. In this work, we establish a framework to systematically determine the ultimate precision limit of different strategies, which include the parallel, the sequential and the indefinite-causal-order strategies. With this framework, we show there exists a hierarchy of the precision limits under different families of strategies. An efficient algorithm to design an optimal strategy compatible with given constraints is provided, which has immediate practical applications.</description>

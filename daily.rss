    <description>The so-called welded tree problem provides an example of a black-box problem that can be solved exponentially faster by a quantum walk than by any classical algorithm. Given the name of a special ENTRANCE vertex, a quantum walk can find another distinguished EXIT vertex using polynomially many queries, though without finding any particular path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. It has been an open problem for twenty years whether there is an efficient quantum algorithm for finding such a path, or if the path-finding problem is hard even for quantum computers. We show that a natural class of efficient quantum algorithms provably cannot find a path from ENTRANCE to EXIT. Specifically, we consider algorithms that, within each branch of their superposition, always store a set of vertex labels that form a connected subgraph including the ENTRANCE, and that only provide these vertex labels as inputs to the oracle. While this does not rule out the possibility of a quantum algorithm that efficiently finds a path, it is unclear how an algorithm could benefit by deviating from this behavior. Our no-go result suggests that, for some problems, quantum algorithms must necessarily forget the path they take to reach a solution in order to outperform classical computation.</description>

    <title>Sample-optimal classical shadows for pure states</title>

    <description>We consider the classical shadows task for pure states in the setting of both joint and independent measurements. The task is to measure few copies of an unknown pure state $\rho$ in order to learn a classical description which suffices to later estimate expectation values of observables. Specifically, the goal is to approximate $\mathrm{Tr}(O \rho)$ for any Hermitian observable $O$ to within additive error $\epsilon$ provided $\mathrm{Tr}(O^2)\leq B$ and $\lVert O \rVert = 1$. Our main result applies to the joint measurement setting, where we show $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{B}\epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples of $\rho$ are necessary and sufficient to succeed with high probability. The upper bound is a quadratic improvement on the previous best sample complexity known for this problem. For the lower bound, we see that the bottleneck is not how fast we can learn the state but rather how much any classical description of $\rho$ can be compressed for observable estimation. In the independent measurement setting, we show that $\mathcal O(\sqrt{Bd} \epsilon^{-1} + \epsilon^{-2})$ samples suffice. Notably, this implies that the random Clifford measurements algorithm of Huang, Kueng, and Preskill, which is sample-optimal for mixed states, is not optimal for pure states. Interestingly, our result also uses the same random Clifford measurements but employs a different estimator.</description>

    <title>Even shorter quantum circuit for phase estimation on early fault-tolerant quantum computers with applications to ground-state energy estimation</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11973</link>
    <author>Zhiyan Ding, Lin Lin</author>
    <pubDate>Nov 23 2022</pubDate>
    <description>We develop a phase estimation method with a distinct feature: its maximal runtime (which determines the circuit depth) is $\delta/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target precision, and the preconstant $\delta$ can be arbitrarily close to $0$ as the initial state approaches the target eigenstate. The total cost of the algorithm satisfies the Heisenberg-limited scaling $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$. This is different from all previous proposals, where $\delta \gtrsim \pi$ is required even if the initial state is an exact eigenstate. As a result, our algorithm may significantly reduce the circuit depth for performing phase estimation tasks on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. The key technique is a simple subroutine called quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS). Our algorithm can be readily applied to reduce the circuit depth for estimating the ground-state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian, when the overlap between the initial state and the ground state is large. If this initial overlap is small, we can combine our method with the Fourier filtering method developed in [Lin, Tong, PRX Quantum 3, 010318, 2022], and the resulting algorithm provably reduces the circuit depth in the presence of a large relative overlap compared to $\epsilon$. The relative overlap condition is similar to a spectral gap assumption, but it is aware of the information in the initial state and is therefore applicable to certain Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps. We observe that the circuit depth can be reduced by around two orders of magnitude in numerical experiments under various settings.</description>

    <title>End-to-end resource analysis for quantum interior point methods and portfolio optimization</title>

    <description>We study quantum interior point methods (QIPMs) for second-order cone programming (SOCP), guided by the example use case of portfolio optimization (PO). We provide a complete quantum circuit-level description of the algorithm from problem input to problem output, making several improvements to the implementation of the QIPM. We report the number of logical qubits and the quantity/depth of non-Clifford T-gates needed to run the algorithm, including constant factors. The resource counts we find depend on instance-specific parameters, such as the condition number of certain linear systems within the problem. To determine the size of these parameters, we perform numerical simulations of small PO instances, which lead to concrete resource estimates for the PO use case. Our numerical results do not probe large enough instance sizes to make conclusive statements about the asymptotic scaling of the algorithm. However, already at small instance sizes, our analysis suggests that, due primarily to large constant pre-factors, poorly conditioned linear systems, and a fundamental reliance on costly quantum state tomography, fundamental improvements to the QIPM are required for it to lead to practical quantum advantage.</description>

    <title>Another Round of Breaking and Making Quantum Money: How to Not Build It from Lattices, and More</title>

    <description>Public verification of quantum money has been one of the central objects in quantum cryptography ever since Wiesner's pioneering idea of using quantum mechanics to construct banknotes against counterfeiting. So far, we do not know any publicly-verifiable quantum money scheme that is provably secure from standard assumptions. In this work, we provide both negative and positive results for publicly verifiable quantum money. **In the first part, we give a general theorem, showing that a certain natural class of quantum money schemes from lattices cannot be secure. We use this theorem to break the recent quantum money scheme of Khesin, Lu, and Shor. **In the second part, we propose a framework for building quantum money and quantum lightning we call invariant money which abstracts some of the ideas of quantum money from knots by Farhi et al.(ITCS'12). In addition to formalizing this framework, we provide concrete hard computational problems loosely inspired by classical knowledge-of-exponent assumptions, whose hardness would imply the security of quantum lightning, a strengthening of quantum money where not even the bank can duplicate banknotes. **We discuss potential instantiations of our framework, including an oracle construction using cryptographic group actions and instantiations from rerandomizable functional encryption, isogenies over elliptic curves, and knots.</description>

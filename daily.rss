    <description>Multipartite entanglement plays an essential role in both quantum information science and many-body physics. Due to the exponentially large dimension and complex geometric structure of the state space, the detection of entanglement in many-body systems is extremely challenging in reality. Conventional means, like entanglement witness and entropy criterion, either highly depend on the prior knowledge of the studied systems or the detection capability is relatively weak. In this work, we propose a framework for designing multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an effective implementation with either the generalized control-SWAP quantum circuits or the random unitary techniques. These criteria show strong detection capability in the multi-qubit Ising model with a long-range $XY$ Hamiltonian. The quantities associated with these criteria have clear physical meaning and can be used as entanglement quantifiers, with which we show the entanglement scaling transition in a quantum dynamical phase transition. Furthermore, our framework can also be generalized to detect the much more complicated entanglement structure in quantum many-body systems.</description>

    <description>Fluctuation theorems provide a correspondence between properties of quantum systems in thermal equilibrium and a work distribution arising in a non-equilibrium process that connects two quantum systems with Hamiltonians $H_0$ and $H_1=H_0+V$. Building upon these theorems, we present a quantum algorithm to prepare a purification of the thermal state of $H_1$ at inverse temperature $\beta \ge 0$ starting from a purification of the thermal state of $H_0$. The complexity of the quantum algorithm, given by the number of uses of certain unitaries, is $\tilde {\cal O}(e^{\beta (\Delta \! A- w_l)/2})$, where $\Delta \! A$ is the free-energy difference between $H_1$ and $H_0,$ and $w_l$ is a work cutoff that depends on the properties of the work distribution and the approximation error $\epsilon>0$. If the non-equilibrium process is trivial, this complexity is exponential in $\beta \|V\|$, where $\|V\|$ is the spectral norm of $V$. This represents a significant improvement of prior quantum algorithms that have complexity exponential in $\beta \|H_1\|$ in the regime where $\|V\|\ll \|H_1\|$. The dependence of the complexity in $\epsilon$ varies according to the structure of the quantum systems. It can be exponential in $1/\epsilon$ in general, but we show it to be sublinear in $1/\epsilon$ if $H_0$ and $H_1$ commute, or polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if $H_0$ and $H_1$ are local spin systems. The possibility of applying a unitary that drives the system out of equilibrium allows one to increase the value of $w_l$ and improve the complexity even further. To this end, we analyze the complexity for preparing the thermal state of the transverse field Ising model using different non-equilibrium unitary processes and see significant complexity improvements.</description>

    <title>Intrinsic randomness under general quantum measurements</title>

    <description>Quantum measurements can produce randomness arising from the uncertainty principle. When measuring a state with von Neumann measurements, the intrinsic randomness can be quantified by the quantum coherence of the state on the measurement basis. Unlike projection measurements, there are additional and possibly hidden degrees of freedom in apparatus for generic measurements. We propose an adversary scenario for general measurements with arbitrary input states, based on which, we characterize the intrinsic randomness. Interestingly, we discover that under certain measurements, such as the symmetric and information-complete measurement, all states have nonzero randomness, inspiring a new design of source-independent random number generators without state characterization. Furthermore, our results show that intrinsic randomness can quantify coherence under general measurements, which generalizes the result in the standard resource theory of state coherence.</description>

    <title>A constant lower bound for any quantum protocol for secure function evaluation</title>

    <description>Secure function evaluation is a two-party cryptographic primitive where Bob computes a function of Alice's and his respective inputs, and both hope to keep their inputs private from the other party. It has been proven that perfect (or near perfect) security is impossible, even for quantum protocols. We generalize this no-go result by exhibiting a constant lower bound on the cheating probabilities for any quantum protocol for secure function evaluation, and present many applications from oblivious transfer to the millionaire's problem. Constant lower bounds are of practical interest since they imply the impossibility to arbitrarily amplify the security of quantum protocols by any means.</description>

    <title>Three numerical approaches to find mutually unbiased bases using Bell inequalities</title>

    <description>Mutually unbiased bases correspond to highly useful pairs of measurements in quantum information theory. In the smallest composite dimension, six, it is known that between three and seven mutually unbiased bases exist, with a decades-old conjecture, known as Zauner's conjecture, stating that there exist at most three. Here we tackle Zauner's conjecture numerically through the construction of Bell inequalities for every pair of integers $n,d \ge 2$ that can be maximally violated in dimension $d$ if and only if $n$ MUBs exist in that dimension. Hence we turn Zauner's conjecture into an optimisation problem, which we address by means of three numerical methods: see-saw optimisation, non-linear semidefinite programming and Monte Carlo techniques. All three methods correctly identify the known cases in low dimensions and all suggest that there do not exist four mutually unbiased bases in dimension six, with all finding the same bases that numerically optimise the corresponding Bell inequality. Moreover, these numerical optimisers appear to coincide with the "four most distant bases" in dimension six, found through numerically optimising a distance measure in [P. Raynal, X. Lü, B.-G. Englert, Phys. Rev. A, 83 062303 (2011)]. Finally, the Monte Carlo results suggest that at most three MUBs exist in dimension ten.</description>

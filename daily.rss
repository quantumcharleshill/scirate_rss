    <description>Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics and holds great promise for enhancing metrology and communications. Much of the focus of quantum metrology to date has been on generating highly entangled quantum states which offer better sensitivity, per resource, than can be achieved classically [1-3]. However, to reach the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks, collective measurements, which generate entanglement between multiple copies of the quantum state, are necessary [4-6]. There is presently no known method for implementing arbitrary, optimal collective measurements on more than two copies of the quantum state. Here we experimentally demonstrate theoretically optimal single-copy (separable) and two-copy (entangled) collective measurements for simultaneously estimating two non-commuting qubit rotations. This allows us to draw fundamental insights about the interpretation of the uncertainty principle. We implement our optimal measurements on superconducting, trapped-ion and photonic systems, providing an indication of how future quantum-enhanced sensing networks may look. This work offers a pathway to extracting the maximal advantage of quantum mechanics for information processing tasks [7, 8].</description>

    <title>Quantum Correlations in Molecules: A Quantum Information Toolbox for Chemists</title>

    <description>The second quantum revolution is all about exploiting the quantum nature of atoms and molecules to execute quantum information processing tasks. To support this growing endeavor and by anticipating the key role of quantum chemistry therein, our work establishes a toolbox for systematically exploring, quantifying and dissecting correlation effects in quantum chemical systems. By utilizing the geometric picture of quantum states we compare -- on a unified basis and in an operationally meaningful way -- total, quantum and classical correlation and entanglement in molecular ground states. To maximize the quantum informational resourcefulness of molecules an orbital optimization scheme is provided, leading to a paradigm-shifting insight: A single covalent bond equates to the entanglement $2\ln(2)$. This novel and more versatile perspective on electronic structure suggests a generalization of valence bond theory, overcoming deficiencies of modern chemical bonding theories.</description>

    <title>Modular Commutators in Conformal Field Theory</title>

    <description>The modular commutator is a recently discovered multipartite entanglement measure that quantifies the chirality of the underlying many-body quantum state. In this Letter, we derive a universal expression for the modular commutator in conformal field theories in $1+1$ dimensions and discuss its salient features. We show that the modular commutator depends only on the chiral central charge and the conformal cross ratio. We test this formula for a gapped $2+1$-dimensional system with a chiral edge, i.e., the quantum Hall state, and observe excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore, we propose the geometric dual of the modular commutator in the AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that the modular commutator can be obtained from a set of crossing angles between intersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces.</description>

    <title>QuanEstimation: an open-source toolkit for quantum parameter estimation</title>

    <description>Quantum parameter estimation promises a high-precision measurement in theory, however, how to design the optimal scheme in a specific scenario, especially under a practical condition, is still a serious problem that needs to be solved case by case due to the existence of multiple mathematical bounds and optimization methods. Depending on the scenario considered, different bounds may be more or less suitable, both in terms of computational complexity and the tightness of the bound itself. At the same time, the metrological schemes provided by different optimization methods need to be tested against realization complexity, robustness, etc. Hence, a comprehensive toolkit containing various bounds and optimization methods is essential for the scheme design in quantum metrology. To fill this vacancy, here we present a Python-Julia-based open-source toolkit for quantum parameter estimation, which includes many well-used mathematical bounds and optimization methods. Utilizing this toolkit, all procedures in the scheme design, such as the optimizations of the probe state, control and measurement, can be readily and efficiently performed.</description>

    <title>Quantum Optimal Control: Practical Aspects and Diverse Methods</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15574</link>

    <description>Quantum controls realize the unitary or nonunitary operations employed in quantum computers, quantum simulators, quantum communications, and other quantum information devices. They implement the desired quantum dynamics with the help of electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic control fields. Quantum optimal control (QOC) deals with designing an optimal control field modulation that most precisely implements a desired quantum operation with minimum energy consumption and maximum robustness against hardware imperfections as well as external noise. Over the last two decades, numerous QOC methods have been proposed. They include asymptotic methods, direct search, gradient methods, variational methods, machine learning methods, etc. In this review, we shall introduce the basic ideas of QOC, discuss practical challenges, and then take an overview of the diverse QOC methods.</description>

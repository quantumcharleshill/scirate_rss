    <description>Quantum pseudorandom states are efficiently constructable states which nevertheless masquerade as Haar-random states to poly-time observers. First defined by Ji, Liu and Song, such states have found a number of applications ranging from cryptography to the AdS/CFT correspondence. A fundamental question is exactly how much entanglement is required to create such states. Haar-random states, as well as $t$-designs for $t\geq 2$, exhibit near-maximal entanglement. Here we provide the first construction of pseudorandom states with only polylogarithmic entanglement entropy across an equipartition of the qubits, which is the minimum possible. Our construction can be based on any one-way function secure against quantum attack. We additionally show that the entanglement in our construction is fully "tunable", in the sense that one can have pseudorandom states with entanglement $\Theta(f(n))$ for any desired function $\omega(\log n) \leq f(n) \leq O(n)$. More fundamentally, our work calls into question to what extent entanglement is a "feelable" quantity of quantum systems. Inspired by recent work of Gheorghiu and Hoban, we define a new notion which we call "pseudoentanglement", which are ensembles of efficiently constructable quantum states which hide their entanglement entropy. We show such states exist in the strongest form possible while simultaneously being pseudorandom states. We also describe diverse applications of our result from entanglement distillation to property testing to quantum gravity.</description>

    <title>Quantum algorithms for classical Boolean functions via adaptive measurements: Exponential reductions in space-time resources</title>

    <description>The limited computational power of constant-depth quantum circuits can be boosted by adapting future gates according to the outcomes of mid-circuit measurements. We formulate computation of a variety of Boolean functions in the framework of adaptive measurement-based quantum computation using a cluster state resource and a classical side-processor that can add bits modulo 2, so-called $l2$-MBQC. Our adaptive approach overcomes a known challenge that computing these functions in the nonadaptive setting requires a resource state that is exponentially large in the size of the computational input. In particular, we construct adaptive $l2$-MBQC algorithms based on the quantum signal processing technique that compute the mod-$p$ functions with the best known scaling in the space-time resources (i.e., qubit count, quantum circuit depth, classical memory size, and number of calls to the side-processor). As the subject is diverse and has a long history, the paper includes reviews of several previously constructed algorithms and recasts them as adaptive $l2$-MBQCs using cluster state resources. Our results constitute an alternative proof of an old theorem regarding an oracular separation between the power of constant-depth quantum circuits and constant-depth classical circuits with unbounded fan-in NAND and mod-$p$ gates for any prime $p$.</description>

    <title>Invertible bimodule categories and generalized Schur orthogonality</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.01947</link>

    <description>The Schur orthogonality relations are a cornerstone in the representation theory of groups. We utilize a generalization to weak Hopf algebras to provide a new, readily verifiable condition on the skeletal data for deciding whether a given bimodule category is invertible and therefore defines a Morita equivalence. As a first application, we provide an algorithm for the construction of the full skeletal data of the invertible bimodule category associated to a given module category, which is obtained in a unitary gauge when the underlying categories are unitary. As a second application, we show that our condition for invertibility is equivalent to the notion of MPO-injectivity, thereby closing an open question concerning tensor network representations of string-net models exhibiting topological order. We discuss applications to generalized symmetries, including a generalized Wigner-Eckart theorem.</description>

    <title>Pseudorandom (Function-Like) Quantum State Generators: New Definitions and Applications</title>

    <description>Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) are efficiently constructible states that are computationally indistinguishable from being Haar-random, and have recently found cryptographic applications. We explore new definitions, new properties and applications of pseudorandom states, and present the following contributions: 1. New Definitions: We study variants of pseudorandom function-like state (PRFS) generators, introduced by Ananth, Qian, and Yuen (CRYPTO'22), where the pseudorandomness property holds even when the generator can be queried adaptively or in superposition. We show feasibility of these variants assuming the existence of post-quantum one-way functions. 2. Classical Communication: We show that PRS generators with logarithmic output length imply commitment and encryption schemes with classical communication. Previous constructions of such schemes from PRS generators required quantum communication. 3. Simplified Proof: We give a simpler proof of the Brakerski--Shmueli (TCC'19) result that polynomially-many copies of uniform superposition states with random binary phases are indistinguishable from Haar-random states. 4. Necessity of Computational Assumptions: We also show that a secure PRS with output length logarithmic, or larger, in the key length necessarily requires computational assumptions.</description>

    <title>On the practical usefulness of the Hardware Efficient Ansatz</title>

    <description>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models train a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a given learning task. The success of these algorithms greatly hinges on appropriately choosing an ansatz for the quantum circuit. Perhaps one of the most famous ansatzes is the one-dimensional layered Hardware Efficient Ansatz (HEA), which seeks to minimize the effect of hardware noise by using native gates and connectives. The use of this HEA has generated a certain ambivalence arising from the fact that while it suffers from barren plateaus at long depths, it can also avoid them at shallow ones. In this work, we attempt to determine whether one should, or should not, use a HEA. We rigorously identify scenarios where shallow HEAs should likely be avoided (e.g., VQA or QML tasks with data satisfying a volume law of entanglement). More importantly, we identify a Goldilocks scenario where shallow HEAs could achieve a quantum speedup: QML tasks with data satisfying an area law of entanglement. We provide examples for such scenario (such as Gaussian diagonal ensemble random Hamiltonian discrimination), and we show that in these cases a shallow HEA is always trainable and that there exists an anti-concentration of loss function values. Our work highlights the crucial role that input states play in the trainability of a parametrized quantum circuit, a phenomenon that is verified in our numerics.</description>

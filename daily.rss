    <title>Free-Fermion Subsystem Codes</title>

    <description>We consider quantum error-correcting subsystem codes whose gauge generators realize a translation-invariant, free-fermion-solvable spin model. In this setting, errors are suppressed by a Hamiltonian whose terms are the gauge generators of the code and whose exact spectrum and eigenstates can be found via a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such solutions are characterized by the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian: the graph whose vertices are Hamiltonian terms, which are neighboring if the terms anticommute. We provide methods for embedding a given frustration graph in the anticommutation relations of a spin model and present the first known example of an exactly solvable spin model with a two-dimensional free-fermion description and exact topological qubits. This model can be viewed as a free-fermionized version of the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code. Using graph-theoretic tools to study the unit cell, we give an efficient algorithm for deciding if a given translation-invariant spin model is solvable, and explicitly construct the solution. Further, we examine the energetics of these exactly solvable models from the graph-theoretic perspective and show that the relevant gaps of the spin model correspond to known graph-theoretic quantities: the skew energy and the median eigenvalue of an oriented graph. Finally, we numerically search for models which have large spectral gaps above the ground state spin configuration and thus exhibit particularly robust thermal suppression of errors. These results suggest that optimal models will have low dimensionality and odd coordination numbers, and that the primary limit to energetic error suppression is the skew energy difference between different symmetry sectors rather than single-particle excitations of the free fermions.</description>

    <title>On Lieb-Robinson Bounds for the Double Bracket Flow</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07141</link>

    <description>We consider the possibility of developing a Lieb-Robinson bound for the double bracket flow. This is a differential equation $$\partial_B H(B)=[[V,H(B)],H(B)]$$ which may be used to diagonalize Hamiltonians. Here, $V$ is fixed and $H(0)=H$. We argue (but do not prove) that $H(B)$ need not converge to a limit for nonzero real $B$ in the infinite volume limit, even assuming several conditions on $H(0)$. However, we prove Lieb-Robinson bounds for all $B$ for the double-bracket flow for free fermion systems, but the range increases \emphexponentially with the control parameter $B$.</description>

    <title>Characterizing Long-Range Entanglement in a Mixed State Through an Emergent Order on the Entangling Surface</title>

    <description>Topologically-ordered phases of matter at non-zero temperature are conjectured to exhibit universal patterns of long-range entanglement which may be detected by a mixed-state entanglement measure known as entanglement negativity. We show that the entanglement negativity in certain topological orders can be understood through the properties of an emergent symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order which is localized on the entanglement bipartition. This connection leads to an understanding of ($i$) universal contributions to the entanglement negativity which diagnose finite-temperature topological order, and ($ii$) the behavior of the entanglement negativity across certain phase transitions in which thermal fluctuations eventually destroy long-range entanglement across the bipartition surface. Within this correspondence, the universal patterns of entanglement in the finite-temperature topological order are related to the stability of an emergent SPT order against a symmetry-breaking field. SPT orders protected by higher-form symmetries -- which arise, for example, in the description of the entanglement negativity for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological order in $d=4$ spatial dimensions -- remain robust even in the presence of a weak symmetry-breaking perturbation, leading to long-range entanglement at non-zero temperature for certain topological orders.</description>

    <title>The Optimization Landscape of Hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithms: from Quantum Control to NISQ Applications</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07448</link>
    <author>Xiaozhen Ge, Re-Bing Wu, Herschel Rabitz</author>
    <pubDate>Jan 20 2022</pubDate>
    <description>This review investigates the landscapes of prevalent hybrid quantum-classical optimization algorithms in many rapidly developing quantum technologies, where the objective function is either computed by a natural quantum system or a quantum ansatz that is engineered, but the optimizer is classical. In any particular case, the nature of the underlying control landscape is fundamentally important for systematic optimization of the objective. In early studies on the optimal control of few-body dynamics, the optimizer could take full control of the quantum systems to be manipulated whose Hilbert space dimension is relatively small. Stepping into the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the experimentally growing computational power of the ansatz expressed as quantum hardware may bring quantum advantage over classical computers, but the classical optimizer is often limited by the available control resources. Across these different scales, we will show that the landscape's geometry experiences morphological changes from favorable trap-free landscapes to easily trapping rugged landscapes, and eventually to barren-plateau landscapes on which the optimizer can hardly move. This unified view provides the basis for understanding classes of systems that may be readily controlled out to those with special consideration, including the difficulties and potential advantages of NISQ technologies, as well as seeking possible ways to escape traps or plateaus, in particular circumstances.</description>

    <title>On the success probability of quantum order finding</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07791</link>

    <description>We prove a lower bound on the probability of Shor's order-finding algorithm successfully recovering the order $r$ in a single run. The bound implies that by performing two limited searches in the classical post-processing part of the algorithm, a high success probability can be guaranteed, for any $r$, without re-running the quantum part or increasing the exponent length compared to Shor. Asymptotically, in the limit as $r$ tends to infinity, the probability of successfully recovering $r$ in a single run tends to one. Already for moderate $r$, a high success probability exceeding e.g. $1 - 10^{-4}$ can be guaranteed. As corollaries, we prove analogous results for the probability of completely factoring any integer $N$ in a single run of the order-finding algorithm.</description>

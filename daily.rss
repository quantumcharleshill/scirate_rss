    <title>Preparing Many Copies of a Quantum State in the Black-Box Model</title>

    <description>We describe a simple quantum algorithm for preparing $K$ copies of an $N$-dimensional quantum state whose amplitudes are given by a quantum oracle. Our result extends a previous work of Grover, who showed how to prepare one copy in time $O(\sqrt{N})$. In comparison with the naive $O(K\sqrt{N})$ solution obtained by repeating this procedure~$K$ times, our algorithm achieves the optimal running time of $\theta(\sqrt{KN})$. Our technique uses a refinement of the quantum rejection sampling method employed by Grover. As a direct application, we obtain a similar speed-up for obtaining $K$ independent samples from a distribution whose probability vector is given by a quantum oracle.</description>

    <title>Analytical bounds for non-asymptotic asymmetric state discrimination</title>

    <description>Two types of errors can occur when discriminating pairs of quantum states. Asymmetric state discrimination involves minimising the probability of one type of error, subject to a constraint on the other. We give explicit expressions bounding the set of achievable errors, using the trace norm, the fidelity, and the quantum Chernoff bound. The upper bound is asymptotically tight and the lower bound is exact for pure states. Unlike asymptotic bounds, our bounds give error values instead of exponents, so can give more precise results when applied to finite-copy state discrimination problems.</description>

    <title>A Faster Quantum Algorithm for Semidefinite Programming via Robust IPM Framework</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11154</link>

    <description>This paper studies a fundamental problem in convex optimization, which is to solve semidefinite programming (SDP) with high accuracy. This paper follows from existing robust SDP-based interior point method analysis due to [Huang, Jiang, Song, Tao and Zhang, FOCS 2022]. While, the previous work only provides an efficient implementation in the classical setting. This work provides a novel quantum implementation. We give a quantum second-order algorithm with high-accuracy in both the optimality and the feasibility of its output, and its running time depending on $\log(1/\epsilon)$ on well-conditioned instances. Due to the limitation of quantum itself or first-order method, all the existing quantum SDP solvers either have polynomial error dependence or low-accuracy in the feasibility.</description>

    <title>Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection: Hardness based on a Weak Quantum Conjecture</title>

    <description>Classically, for many computational problems one can conclude time lower bounds conditioned on the hardness of one or more of key problems: k-SAT, 3SUM and APSP. More recently, similar results have been derived in the quantum setting conditioned on the hardness of k-SAT and 3SUM. This is done using fine-grained reductions, where the approach is to (1) select a key problem $X$ that, for some function $T$, is conjectured to not be solvable by any $O(T(n)^{1-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for any constant $\epsilon > 0$ (in a fixed model of computation), and (2) reduce $X$ in a fine-grained way to these computational problems, thus giving (mostly) tight conditional time lower bounds for them. Interestingly, for Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection, classical hardness results have been derived conditioned on hardness of all three mentioned key problems. More precisely, it is proven that an $n^{3-\epsilon}$ time classical algorithm for either of these two graph problems would imply faster classical algorithms for k-SAT, 3SUM and APSP, which makes Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection worthwhile to study. In this paper, we show that an $n^{1.5-\epsilon}$ time quantum algorithm for either of these two graph problems would imply faster quantum algorithms for k-SAT, 3SUM, and APSP. We first formulate a quantum hardness conjecture for APSP and then present quantum reductions from k-SAT, 3SUM, and APSP to Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection. Additionally, based on the quantum APSP conjecture, we are also able to prove quantum lower bounds for a matrix problem and many graph problems. The matching upper bounds follow trivially for most of them, except for Delta-Matching Triangles and Triangle Collection for which we present quantum algorithms that require careful use of data structures and Ambainis' variable time search.</description>

    <title>Which Bath-Hamiltonians Matter for Thermal Operations?</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11189</link>

    <description>In this article we explore the set of thermal operations from a mathematical and topological point of view. First we introduce the concept of Hamiltonians with resonant spectrum with respect to some reference Hamiltonian, followed by proving that in the definition of the thermal operations it suffices to only consider bath Hamiltonians which satisfy this resonance property. Next we investigate continuity of the set of thermal operations in the parameters of the system, such as energies of the system and temperature of the bath. We will see that the set of thermal operations changes discontinuously with respect to the Hausdorff metric at any Hamiltonian which has so-called degenerate Bohr spectrum, regardless of the temperature. Finally we find a semigroup representation of the (enhanced) thermal operations in two dimensions by characterizing any such operation via three real parameters, thus allowing for a visualization of this set. Using this, in the qubit case we show commutativity of the (enhanced) thermal operations as well as convexity of the thermal operations without the closure. The latter is done by specifying the elements of this set exactly.</description>

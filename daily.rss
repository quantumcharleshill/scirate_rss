    <description>Using near-term quantum computers to achieve a quantum advantage requires efficient strategies to improve the performance of the noisy quantum devices presently available. We develop and experimentally validate two efficient error mitigation protocols named "Noiseless Output Extrapolation" and "Pauli Error Cancellation" that can drastically enhance the performance of quantum circuits composed of noisy cycles of gates. By combining popular mitigation strategies such as probabilistic error cancellation and noise amplification with efficient noise reconstruction methods, our protocols can mitigate a wide range of noise processes that do not satisfy the assumptions underlying existing mitigation protocols, including non-local and gate-dependent processes. We test our protocols on a four-qubit superconducting processor at the Advanced Quantum Testbed. We observe significant improvements in the performance of both structured and random circuits, with up to $86\%$ improvement in variation distance over the unmitigated outputs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocols, as well as their practicality for current hardware platforms.</description>

    <title>Tailored cluster states with high threshold under biased noise</title>

    <description>Fault-tolerant cluster states form the basis for scalable measurement-based quantum computation. Recently, new stabilizer codes for scalable circuit-based quantum computation have been introduced that have very high thresholds under biased noise where the qubit predominantly suffers from one type of error, e.g. dephasing. However, extending these advances in stabilizer codes to generate high-threshold cluster states for biased noise has been a challenge, as the standard method for foliating stabilizer codes to generate fault-tolerant cluster states does not preserve the noise bias. In this work, we overcome this barrier by introducing a generalization of the cluster state that allows us to foliate stabilizer codes in a bias-preserving way. As an example of our approach, we construct a foliated version of the XZZX code which we call the XZZX cluster state. We demonstrate that under a circuit-level noise model, our XZZX cluster state has a threshold more than double the usual cluster state when dephasing errors are more likely than errors which cause bit flips by a factor of $O(100)$ or more.</description>

    <title>Simultaneous Measurement and Entanglement</title>

    <description>We study scenarios which arise when two spatially-separated observers, Alice and Bob, are try to identify a quantum state sampled from several possibilities. In particular, we examine their strategies for maximizing both the probability of guessing their state correctly as well as their information gain about it. It is known that there are scenarios where allowing Alice and Bob to use LOCC offers an improvement over the case where they must make their measurements simultaneously. Similarly, Alice and Bob can sometimes improve their outcomes if they have access to a Bell pair. We show how LOCC allows Alice and Bob to distinguish between two product states optimally and find that a LOCC is almost always more helpful than a Bell pair for distinguishing product states.</description>

    <title>An Efficient Quantum Readout Error Mitigation for Sparse Measurement Outcomes of Near-term Quantum Devices</title>

    <description>The readout error on the near-term quantum devices is one of the dominant noise factors, which can be mitigated by classical post-processing called quantum readout error mitigation (QREM). The standard QREM method applies the inverse of noise calibration matrix to the outcome probability distribution using exponential computational resources to the system size. Hence this standard approach is not applicable to the current quantum devices with tens of qubits and more. We propose two efficient QREM methods on such devices whose computational complexity is $O(ns^2)$ for probability distributions on measuring $n$ qubits with $s$ shots. The main targets of the proposed methods are the sparse probability distributions where only a few states are dominant. We compare the proposed methods with several recent QREM methods on the following three cases: expectation values of GHZ state, its fidelities, and the estimation error of maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) algorithm with modified Grover iterator. The two cases of the GHZ state are on real IBM quantum devices, while the third is by numerical simulation. The proposed methods can be applied to mitigate GHZ states up to 65 qubits on IBM Quantum devices within a few seconds to confirm the existence of a 29-qubit GHZ state with fidelity larger than 0.5. The proposed methods also succeed in the estimation of the amplitude in MLAE with the modified Grover operator where other QREM methods fail.</description>

    <title>Basic Quantum Algorithms</title>

    <description>Quantum computing is evolving so quickly that forces us to revisit, rewrite, and update the basis of the theory. Basic Quantum Algorithms revisits the first quantum algorithms. It started in 1995 with Deutsch trying to evaluate a function at two domain points simultaneously. Then, Deutsch and Jozsa created in 1992 a quantum algorithm that determines whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced. In the next year, Bernstein and Vazirani realized that the same algorithm can be used to find a specific Boolean function in the set of linear Boolean functions. In 1994, Simon presented a new quantum algorithm that determines whether a function is one-to-one or two-to-one exponentially faster than any classical algorithm for the same problem. In the same year, Shor created two new quantum algorithms for factoring integers and calculating discrete logarithms, threatening the cryptography methods widely used nowadays. In 1995, Kitaev described an alternative version for Shor's algorithms that proved useful in many other applications. In the following year, Grover created a quantum search algorithm quadratically faster than its classical counterpart. In this work, all those remarkable algorithms are described in detail with a focus on the circuit model.</description>

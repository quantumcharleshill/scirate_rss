    <description>Fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computation is commonly acknowledged to be crucial to the realisation of large-scale quantum algorithms that could lead to extremely impactful scientific or commercial results. Achieving a universal set of quantum gate operations in a fault-tolerant error-corrected framework suffers from a `conservation of unpleasantness'. In general, no matter what error correction technique is employed, there is always one element of a universal gate set that carries a significant resource overhead - either in physical qubits, computational time, or both. Specifically, this is due to the application of non-Clifford gates. A common method for realising these gates for stabiliser codes such as the surface code is a combination of three protocols: state injection, distillation and gate teleportation. These protocols contribute to the resource overhead compared to logical operations such as a CNOT gate and contributes to the qubit resources for any error-corrected quantum algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a very simple protocol to potentially reduce this overhead for non-Clifford gates: Transversal Injection. Transversal injection modifies the initial physical states of all data qubits in a stabiliser code before standard encoding and results in the direct preparation of a large class of single qubit states, including resource states for non-Clifford logic gates. Preliminary results hint at high quality fidelities at larger distances and motivate further research on this technique.</description>

    <title>Closed-form analytic expressions for shadow estimation with brickwork circuits</title>

    <description>Properties of quantum systems can be estimated using classical shadows, which implement measurements based on random ensembles of unitaries. Originally derived for global Clifford unitaries and products of single-qubit Clifford gates, practical implementations are limited to the latter scheme for moderate numbers of qubits. Beyond local gates, the accurate implementation of very short random circuits with two-local gates is still experimentally feasible and, therefore, interesting for implementing measurements in near-term applications. In this work, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for shadow estimation using brickwork circuits with two layers of parallel two-local Haar-random (or Clifford) unitaries. Besides the construction of the classical shadow, our results give rise to sample-complexity guarantees for estimating Pauli observables. We then compare the performance of shadow estimation with brickwork circuits to the established approach using local Clifford unitaries and find improved sample complexity in the estimation of observables supported on sufficiently many qubits.</description>

    <title>Magic of Random Matrix Product States</title>

    <description>Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing. In this paper, we study the magic of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) by the $L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm. We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the $1$D RMPS is highly magical. Our numerical results confirm that the magic grows exponentially in the qubit case.</description>

    <title>What aspects of the phenomenology of interference witness nonclassicality?</title>

    <description>Interference phenomena are often claimed to resist classical explanation. However, such claims are undermined by the fact that the specific aspects of the phenomenology upon which they are based can in fact be reproduced in a noncontextual ontological model [Catani et al. arXiv:2111.13727]. This raises the question of what other aspects of the phenomenology of interference do in fact resist classical explanation. We answer this question by demonstrating that the most basic quantum wave-particle duality relation, which expresses the precise trade-off between path distinguishability and fringe visibility, cannot be reproduced in any noncontextual model. We do this by showing that it is a specific type of uncertainty relation, and then leveraging a recent result establishing that noncontextuality restricts the functional form of this uncertainty relation [Catani et al. arXiv:2207.11779]. Finally, we discuss what sorts of interferometric experiment can demonstrate contextuality via the wave-particle duality relation.</description>

    <title>Scrambling and Quantum Teleportation</title>

    <description>Scrambling is a concept introduced from information loss problem arising in black hole. In this paper we discuss the effect of scrambling from a perspective of pure quantum information theory. We introduce $7$-qubit quantum circuit for a quantum teleportation. It is shown that the teleportation can be perfect if a maximal scrambling unitary is used. From this fact we conjecture that ``the quantity of scrambling is proportional to the fidelity of teleportation''. In order to confirm the conjecture we introduce $\theta$-dependent partially scrambling unitary, which reduces to no scrambling and maximal scrambling at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi / 2$, respectively. Then, we compute the average fidelity analytically, and numerically by making use of qiskit (version $0.36.2$) and $7$-qibit real quantum computer ibm$\_$oslo. Finally, we conclude that our conjecture can be true or false depending on the choice of qubits for Bell measurement.</description>

    <title>Short Proofs of Linear Growth of Quantum Circuit Complexity</title>

    <description>The complexity of a quantum gate, defined as the minimal number of elementary gates to build it, is an important concept in quantum information and computation. It is shown recently that the complexity of quantum gates built from random quantum circuits almost surely grows linearly with the number of building blocks. In this article, we provide two short proofs of this fact. We also discuss a discrete version of quantum circuit complexity growth.</description>

    <description>Variational quantum machine learning is an extensively studied application of near-term quantum computers. The success of variational quantum learning models crucially depends on finding a suitable parametrization of the model that encodes an inductive bias relevant to the learning task. However, precious little is known about guiding principles for the construction of suitable parametrizations. In this work, we holistically explore when and how symmetries of the learning problem can be exploited to construct quantum learning models with outcomes invariant under the symmetry of the learning task. Building on tools from representation theory, we show how a standard gateset can be transformed into an equivariant gateset that respects the symmetries of the problem at hand through a process of gate symmetrization. We benchmark the proposed methods on two toy problems that feature a non-trivial symmetry and observe a substantial increase in generalization performance. As our tools can also be applied in a straightforward way to other variational problems with symmetric structure, we show how equivariant gatesets can be used in variational quantum eigensolvers.</description>

    <title>Beyond Barren Plateaus: Quantum Variational Algorithms Are Swamped With Traps</title>

    <description>One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models -- which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateus -- have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.</description>

    <title>Multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP): prophecies of the two-headed oracle</title>

    <description>Recent work shows that quantum signal processing (QSP) and its multi-qubit lifted version, quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), unify and improve the presentation of most quantum algorithms. QSP/QSVT characterize the ability, by alternating ansätze, to obliviously transform the singular values of subsystems of unitary matrices by polynomial functions; these algorithms are numerically stable and analytically well-understood. That said, QSP/QSVT require consistent access to a single oracle, and say nothing about computing joint properties of two or more oracles; these can be far cheaper to compute given the ability to pit oracles against one another coherently. This work introduces a corresponding theory of QSP over multiple variables: M-QSP. Surprisingly, despite the non-existence of the fundamental theorem of algebra for multivariable polynomials, there exist necessary and sufficient conditions under which a desired stable multivariable polynomial transformation is possible. Moreover, the classical subroutines used by QSP protocols survive in the multivariable setting for non-obvious reasons. Up to a well-defined conjecture, we give proof that the family of achievable multivariable transforms is as loosely constrained as could be expected. M-QSP is numerically stable and inherits the approximative efficiency of its single-variable analogue; however, its underlying theory is substantively more complex. M-QSP provides one bridge from quantum algorithms to a rich theory of algebraic geometry over multiple variables. The unique ability of M-QSP to obliviously approximate joint functions of multiple variables coherently leads to novel speedups incommensurate with those of other quantum algorithms.</description>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidate for near-term advantage on noisy quantum hardware. When training a parametrized quantum circuit to solve a specific task, the choice of ansatz is one of the most important factors that determines the trainability and performance of the algorithm. Problem-tailored ansatzes have become the standard for tasks in optimization or quantum chemistry, and yield more efficient algorithms with better performance than unstructured approaches. In quantum machine learning (QML), however, the literature on ansatzes that are motivated by the training data structure is scarce. Considering that it is widely known that unstructured ansatzes can become untrainable with increasing system size and circuit depth, it is of key importance to also study problem-tailored circuit architectures in a QML context. In this work, we introduce an ansatz for learning tasks on weighted graphs that respects an important graph symmetry, namely equivariance under node permutations. We evaluate the performance of this ansatz on a complex learning task on weighted graphs, where a ML model is used to implement a heuristic for a combinatorial optimization problem. We analytically study the expressivity of our ansatz at depth one, and numerically compare the performance of our model on instances with up to 20 qubits to ansatzes where the equivariance property is gradually broken. We show that our ansatz outperforms all others even in the small-instance regime. Our results strengthen the notion that symmetry-preserving ansatzes are a key to success in QML and should be an active area of research in order to enable near-term advantages in this field.</description>

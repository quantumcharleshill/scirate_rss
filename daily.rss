    <title>Perturbation Theory and the Sum of Squares</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12325</link>

    <description>The sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy is a powerful technique based on semi-definite programming that can be used for both classical and quantum optimization problems. This hierarchy goes under several names; in particular, in quantum chemistry it is called the reduced density matrix (RDM) method. We consider the ability of this hierarchy to reproduce weak coupling perturbation theory for three different kinds of systems: spin (or qubit) systems, bosonic systems (the anharmonic oscillator), and fermionic systems with quartic interactions. For such fermionic systems, we show that degree-$4$ SoS (called $2$-RDM in quantum chemsitry) does not reproduce second order perturbation theory but degree-$6$ SoS ($3$-RDM) does (and we conjecture that it reproduces third order perturbation theory). Indeed, we identify a fragment of degree-$6$ SoS which can do this, which may be useful for practical quantum chemical calculations as it may be possible to implement this fragment with less cost than the full degree-$6$ SoS. Remarkably, this fragment is very similar to one studied by Hastings and O'Donnell for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.</description>

    <title>Measurement incompatibility vs. Bell non-locality: an approach via tensor norms</title>

    <description>Measurement incompatibility and quantum non-locality are two key features of quantum theory. Violations of Bell inequalities require quantum entanglement and incompatibility of the measurements used by the two parties involved in the protocol. We analyze the converse question: for which Bell inequalities is the incompatibility of measurements enough to ensure a quantum violation? We relate the two questions by comparing two tensor norms on the space of dichotomic quantum measurements: one characterizing measurement compatibility and the second one characterizing violations of a given Bell inequality. We provide sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two notions in terms of the matrix describing the correlation Bell inequality. We show that the CHSH inequality and its variants are the only ones satisfying it.</description>

    <title>The battle of clean and dirty qubits in the era of partial error correction</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13454</link>

    <description>When error correction becomes possible it will be necessary to dedicate a large number of physical qubits to each logical qubit. Error correction allows for deeper circuits to be run, but each additional physical qubit can potentially contribute an exponential increase in computational space, so there is a trade-off between using qubits for error correction or using them as noisy qubits. In this work we look at the effects of using noisy qubits in conjunction with noiseless qubits (an idealized model for error-corrected qubits), which we call the "clean and dirty" setup. We employ analytical models and numerical simulations to characterize this setup. Numerically we show the appearance of Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBPs), i.e., an exponential concentration of observables caused by noise, in an Ising model Hamiltonian variational ansatz circuit. We observe this even if only a single qubit is noisy and given a deep enough circuit, suggesting that NIBPs cannot be fully overcome simply by error-correcting a subset of the qubits. On the positive side, we find that for every noiseless qubit in the circuit, there is an exponential suppression in concentration of gradient observables, showing the benefit of partial error correction. Finally, our analytical models corroborate these findings by showing that observables concentrate with a scaling in the exponent related to the ratio of dirty-to-total qubits.</description>

    <title>Simulation Complexity of Many-Body Localized Systems</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12967</link>

    <description>We use complexity theory to rigorously investigate the difficulty of classically simulating evolution under many-body localized (MBL) Hamiltonians. Using the defining feature that MBL systems have a complete set of quasilocal integrals of motion (LIOMs), we demonstrate a transition in the classical complexity of simulating such systems as a function of evolution time. On one side, we construct a quasipolynomial-time tensor-network-inspired algorithm for strong simulation of 1D MBL systems (i.e., calculating the expectation value of arbitrary products of local observables) evolved for any time polynomial in the system size. On the other side, we prove that even weak simulation, i.e. sampling, becomes formally hard after an exponentially long evolution time, assuming widely believed conjectures in complexity theory. Finally, using the consequences of our classical simulation results, we also show that the quantum circuit complexity for MBL systems is sublinear in evolution time. This result is a counterpart to a recent proof that the complexity of random quantum circuits grows linearly in time.</description>

    <title>Mitigating barren plateaus of variational quantum eigensolvers</title>

    <description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are expected to establish valuable applications on near-term quantum computers. However, recent works have pointed out that the performance of VQAs greatly relies on the capability of the ansatzes and is seriously limited by optimization issues such as barren plateaus (i.e., vanishing gradients). This work proposes the state efficient ansatz (SEA) for accurate quantum dynamics simulations with improved trainability. First, we show that SEA can generate an arbitrary pure state with much fewer parameters than a universal ansatz, making it efficient for tasks like ground state estimation. It also has the flexibility in adjusting the entanglement of the prepared state, which could be applied to further improve the efficiency of simulating weak entanglement. Second, we show that SEA is not a unitary 2-design even if it has universal wavefunction expressibility and thus has great potential to improve the trainability by avoiding the zone of barren plateaus. We further investigate a plethora of examples in ground state estimation and notably obtain significant improvements in the variances of derivatives and the overall optimization behaviors. This result indicates that SEA can mitigate barren plateaus by sacrificing the redundant expressibility for the target problem.</description>

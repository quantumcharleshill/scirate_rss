    <title>isQ: Towards a Practical Software Stack for Quantum Programming</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03866</link>

    <description>We introduce isQ, a new software stack for quantum programming in an imperative programming language, also named isQ. The aim of isQ is to make the programmers write quantum programs as conveniently as possible. In particular: 1) The isQ language and its compiler contain many features, including some not well supported by (most) other quantum programming platforms, e.g. classical control flow such as recursion; decomposition of selfdefined unitary gates; and oracle programming and its circuit realization. 2) To make it flexible, an isQ program can be compiled into several kinds of intermediate representation, including OpenQASM 3.0, QIR and QCIS (specially tailored for the superconducting quantum hardware at USTC). 3) Besides interfacing isQ with true superconducting hardware, a QIR simulator is also developed for demonstration and testing of isQ programs.</description>

    <title>Characterizing nonlocality depth with the cone-projection technique</title>

    <description>When three or more particles are considered, quantum correlations can be stronger than the correlations generated by so-called hybrid local hidden variable models, where some of the particles are considered as a single block inside which communication and signaling is allowed. We provide an exhaustive classification of Bell inequalities to characterize various hybrid scenarios in four- and five- particle systems. In quantum mechanics, these inequalities provide device-independent witnesses for the entanglement depth. In addition, we construct a family of inequalities to detect a non-locality depth of $(n - 1)$ in $n$-particle systems. Moreover, we present two generalizations of the original Svetlichny inequality, which was the first Bell inequality designed for hybrid models. Our results are based on the cone-projection technique, which can be used to completely characterize Bell inequalities under affine constraints; even for many parties, measurements, and outcomes.</description>

    <title>Fundamental limitations on optimization in variational quantum algorithms</title>

    <description>Exploring quantum applications of near-term quantum devices is a rapidly growing field of quantum information science with both theoretical and practical interests. A leading paradigm to establish such near-term quantum applications is variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). These algorithms use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit to accomplish certain tasks, where the circuits are usually randomly initialized. In this work, we prove that for a broad class of such random circuits, the variation range of the cost function via adjusting any local quantum gate within the circuit vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits with a high probability. This result can unify the restrictions on gradient-based and gradient-free optimizations in a natural manner and reveal extra harsh constraints on the training landscapes of VQAs. Hence a fundamental limitation on the trainability of VQAs is unraveled, indicating the essence of the optimization hardness in the Hilbert space with exponential dimension. We further showcase the validity of our results with numerical simulations of representative VQAs. We believe that these results would deepen our understanding of the scalability of VQAs and shed light on the search for near-term quantum applications with advantages.</description>

    <title>Classical verification of quantum depth</title>

    <description>We present two protocols for classical verification of quantum depth. Our protocols allow a purely classical verifier to distinguish devices with different quantum circuit depths even in the presence of classical computation. We show that a device with quantum circuit depth at most d will be rejected by the verifier even if the prover applies additional polynomial-time classical computation to cheat. On the other hand, the verifier accepts a device which has quantum circuit depth d' for some d'>d. In our first protocol, we introduce an additional untrusted quantum machine which shares entanglements with the target machine. Applying a robust self-test, our first protocol certifies the depth of the target machine with information theoretic security and nearly optimal separation. The protocol relies on the oracle separation problem for quantum depth by Chia, Chung and Lai [STOC 2020] and a transformation from an oracle separation problem to a two-player non-local game. Our second protocol certifies the quantum depth of a single device based on quantum hardness of learning with errors. The protocol relies on the noisy trapdoor claw-free function family and the idea of pointer chasing to force the prover to keep quantum coherence until all preceding message exchanges are completed. To our knowledge, we give the first constructions for distinguishing hybrid quantum-classical computers with different circuit depths in unrelativized models.</description>

    <title>An optimal oracle separation of classical and quantum hybrid schemes</title>
    <link>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04633</link>

    <description>Recently, Chia, Chung and Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron and Menda (STOC 2020) have shown that there exists an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathsf{BQP}^\mathcal{O} \neq (\mathsf{BPP^{BQNC}})^\mathcal{O} \cup (\mathsf{BQNC^{BPP}})^\mathcal{O}$. In fact, Chia et al. proved a stronger statement: for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an oracle that separates quantum depth $d$ and $2d+1$, when polynomial-time classical computation is allowed. This implies that relative to an oracle, doubling quantum depth gives classical and quantum hybrid schemes more computational power. In this paper, we show that for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an oracle that separates quantum depth $d$ and $d+1$, when polynomial-time classical computation is allowed. This gives an optimal oracle separation of classical and quantum hybrid schemes. To prove our result, we consider $d$-Bijective Shuffling Simon's Problem (which is a variant of $d$-Shuffling Simon's Problem considered by Chia et al.) and an oracle inspired by an "in-place" permutation oracle.</description>
